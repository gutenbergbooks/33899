<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p class="cenhead">TO</p>
<h3>THE FIFTH EDITION</h3>

  <p>The first edition of this work was written by my father, the late Mr.
  Lewis Wright, and was published in 1890.</p>

  <p>The reception that it received testified to the fact that it met a
  long-felt want, and successive editions were published in 1895, 1901, and
  1906.</p>

  <p>My father, unfortunately, met his death in a railway accident in 1905,
  and the corrections and additions to the last edition, which had been to
  a certain extent prepared by him, were completed and written by myself,
  and the work as published then was again reprinted in 1911.</p>

  <p>As the original text is now thirty years old, it has seemed better
  entirely to re-write the whole book rather than make fresh revisions, the
  more so as the last ten years have seen great advances in the science of
  Lantern Projection, and especially in the developments of Acetylene and
  Electric Lighting.</p>

  <p>It has also seemed best at the present juncture to issue the book in
  two parts, the first dealing with the Projection of Lantern Slides only,
  and the second with the Demonstration of Opaque and Microscopic Objects,
  Scientific Phenomena and accessory apparatus, including Cinematograph
  Projection.</p>

  <p>It must of necessity be many months before this second volume can be
  produced, for the simple reason that Optical <!-- Page vi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>Instrument Makers have as
  yet hardly had time to turn round after the war and produce their new
  models, and therefore any such book written now could do little more than
  describe apparatus that was on the market prior to 1914.</p>

  <p>The present work, therefore, deals solely with the exhibition of
  Lantern Slides in the Optical Lantern, and as such I trust will be found
  of value to Schoolmasters, Social Workers, Lecturers, and, in fact, to
  all who use the lantern as a means of illustration.</p>

<h2>OPTICAL PROJECTION</h2>

<h3>A TREATISE ON THE USE OF THE OPTICAL
LANTERN</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="cenhead">INTRODUCTORY</p>

  <p>Lantern Projection, as commonly understood, may be broadly subdivided
  into two branches: (A) The Projection of Lantern Slides, and (B) The
  Projection of Scientific Phenomena, Opaque Objects, Microscopic
  Specimens, &amp;c., usually referred to broadly under the heading of
  'Scientific Demonstration.'</p>

  <p>To these two classes may perhaps now be added a third, viz. The
  Projection of So-called Living Pictures, or, in other words, the
  Cinematograph. In the earlier editions of this work both A and B were
  dealt with in the same volume, but, as there are thousands who require to
  use a lantern for the demonstration of lantern slides only, and who have
  no interest or concern with Science Projection, it has seemed to the
  writer that the work might, with advantage, be divided into two portions,
  Vol. I. dealing with slides only, and Vol. II. with the various
  adaptations of the science lantern. This present book therefore only
  deals with the exhibition of lantern slides, and as such it will, I
  trust, be found to be of real assistance to the ordinary user of the
  optical lantern, including clergymen, schoolmasters, army and cadet
  officers, and others <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>who require advice and instruction in the
  purchase or use of a lantern.</p>

  <p>The essential parts of a lantern are: (<i>a</i>) A <i>slide-holder</i>
  or <i>carrier</i> to hold the slide; (<i>b</i>) a <i>lens</i> to 'focus'
  it on the screen; (<i>c</i>) a <i>condenser</i> to converge the light
  upon slide and lens; (<i>d</i>) a source of light or <i>radiant</i> to
  provide the necessary illumination; and (<i>e</i>) a <i>body</i> or
  framework to hold the whole together. All possible variations in choice
  of a suitable lantern relate to one or another of the above parts, and
  will be treated of in turn; but, fortunately, we have this all-important
  simplification that every ordinary English lantern slide is the same
  <i>standard size</i>, viz. 3¼ inches square. Some Continental and
  American slides differ in one dimension from the above, but not enough to
  cause any serious difficulty, and the convenient English standard is
  being gradually adopted throughout the world.</p>

  <p>The varieties of slide-holders or carriers are therefore comparatively
  few and are chiefly concerned with the question of rapidly and easily
  changing the slides. The choice of a focussing lens or objective is
  mainly a matter of the size of picture required, and the most convenient
  distance from the screen for the lantern to be placed. Variations in
  condensers, which are comparatively small, are usually only a matter of
  conforming these with the size or type of objective to be used, and
  should be left to the manufacturer's judgment. The question of a suitable
  radiant is partly a matter of the amount of illumination required, and
  partly that of the practical possibilities; for example, if electric
  current is available some form of electric light is usually the most
  convenient, as well as the least expensive, but where this is not the
  case, paraffin-oil, methylated spirit, incandescent gas, acetylene,
  limelight, &amp;c., are alternatives which all have their uses and must
  be considered on their own merits.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, as for example in the case of a travelling lecturer, a
  lantern is required fitted with a range of lenses for <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>halls of different
  size, and also with a variety of illuminants, and this in most lanterns
  can be easily provided for.</p>

  <p>The body is usually a matter of taste and price only, and may range
  from a simple but efficient shell of Russian iron to an elaborate
  mahogany instrument with a brass front, screw tilting arrangements and
  other adornments; but of late years there has been a wholesome reaction
  against unnecessary finish, and a simple metal body of some description
  is now chiefly the order of the day. In the foregoing remarks the various
  parts of a lantern have been mentioned in what I should consider the
  correct order, starting from the slide and slide-holder, and so to speak
  building up the rest of the instrument round these items; but I now
  propose somewhat to vary the procedure and for convenience deal in detail
  first with the Radiant, or <i>Illuminant</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE ILLUMINANT</p>

  <p>The first necessity for lantern projection is a strong light, and this
  can be obtained from a variety of sources, the principal means in common
  use being approximately in order of excellence as follows: paraffin-oil,
  incandescent spirit, incandescent gas, acetylene, acetylene air blast,
  oxyhydrogen (limelight), oxyether, and electric light in its various
  forms. The ideal characteristics to be sought for are (1) great intrinsic
  brilliancy; (2) minimum <i>size</i> of luminous spot; (3) freedom from
  flicker; (4) freedom from smell; (5) absence of any preponderating
  colour; (6) cheapness; and (7) convenience. There is no question whatever
  as to which of the available sources of light most perfectly combines all
  the above if it is available, viz. the electric arc. If a current supply
  is in <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>the building, this form of lighting easily
  excels all others, except possibly in the matter of flicker, and even in
  this respect there is very little fault to be found with it.</p>

  <p>From all other points of view it is wellnigh perfect, inasmuch as it
  provides an extremely concentrated and intensely luminous spot, of almost
  perfect whiteness (if anything slightly bluish), no smell, comparatively
  little heat, convenient and inexpensive. So great is the advantage of the
  electric arc that attempts have been made to use it from accumulators in
  places where a current supply is not available, but this cannot be
  seriously recommended, except in special cases. Where an electric supply
  is, however, available there can be no real choice, whether the lantern
  is required for use in a large hall or a small class-room. The advantages
  of using the arc are so great that no other method need be seriously
  considered.</p>

  <p>The one real objection that I have heard urged against it is due,
  curiously enough, to its very perfection, and that is, that it lends
  itself to such exceedingly sharp definition that any slight imperfection
  in the slide is too faithfully reproduced on the screen, for which reason
  it is sometimes recommended that the operator shall work with the
  objective the least fraction out of focus; but this is a matter for
  individual taste and judgment.</p>

  <p>If, however, there is no possibility of using the electric current,
  one of the other sources of illumination must perforce be adopted, and
  for a <i>large</i> hall this can only be limelight in one of its many
  forms, viz. oxyhydrogen, oxyether, oxyacetylene, &amp;c. As regards
  results on the screen, this light compares well even against the electric
  arc, but it involves the expense and trouble of compressed gas cylinders,
  or the infinitely worse recourse to the now obsolete method of filling
  gas-bags.</p>

  <p>Limelight is therefore now but little used in this country, as the
  majority of large halls are equipped with the electric <!-- Page 5
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>current, and for
  smaller buildings it is deemed unnecessary and too expensive.</p>

  <p><b>Acetylene</b> is undoubtedly the illuminant most in favour next to
  electric light, as the light is brilliant enough to illuminate a picture
  12 feet in diameter at a distance up to, say, 30 feet from the screen,
  and this suffices in a large majority of cases, and acetylene is
  comparatively cheap, and reasonably simple to work.</p>

  <p><b>Incandescent-gas</b> is often employed for small class-rooms and is
  fairly effective for a picture not exceeding 9 or 10 feet in diameter,
  and the same can be said of the same type of burner heated by methylated
  spirit.</p>

  <p><b>Paraffin-oil</b> is the poorest of all present-day forms of lantern
  illuminants. The flame is large, impairing the definition, yellow in
  colour, uneven in illumination, liable to smoke and smell, and barely
  equal to incandescent gas in illuminating power.</p>

  <p>It is therefore going gradually out of use in this country, but in
  out-of-the-way places, especially abroad, it is sometimes the only
  practicable light, and is therefore still employed from the best of all
  reasons, necessity.</p>

  <p>It is not the intention of the author to give precise working
  instruction for all and every variety of the above illuminants as
  manufactured by different firms. For such the reader must be referred to
  the directions usually issued by the makers themselves, but a general
  description of the various types offered for choice will not be out of
  place, and it will be more convenient to begin with the poorest, viz.
  paraffin-oil, and finish with the most perfect, the electric arc.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="cenhead">PARAFFIN-OIL LAMPS, INCANDESCENT GAS AND
SPIRIT BURNERS</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">
      <a href="images/Fig01.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig01.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 1.--Oil Lamp" title="Fig. 1.--Oil Lamp" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Oil Lamp.
  </div>

  <p>There are several varieties of oil lamps on the market, but in
  practically every case they take the same general form, a metal reservoir
  sliding in grooves in the lantern body and holding approximately a pint
  of oil with (usually) four wicks <i>nearly</i> parallel, but slightly
  converging from rear to front, these enclosed in a flame chamber of
  Russian iron, with <i>loose</i> well-annealed ends of sheet glass and an
  adjustable reflector at the back, or sometimes the reflector itself forms
  the rear end of the flame chamber. The chimney must be tall and is now
  usually made adjustable, though I have never been able to trace any real
  advantage from this complication <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>{7}</span>(Fig. 1). The whole secret of obtaining the
  best results from these lamps may be summed up&mdash;<i>good oil and
  perfect cleanliness</i>; and it is wonderful what can be done when these
  points are properly attended to.</p>

  <p>Care should be taken in trimming the wicks to see that no charred
  parts fall down between the wick holders, but it makes little difference
  whether the trimming is done with scissors or by rubbing with the finger.
  Special lamp scissors are sold by all makers with a large flat on one
  side to catch the portions cut off.</p>

  <p>These lamps should be well rubbed over the last thing before use, as
  paraffin-oil is apt to 'creep,' and the operator does not want to be told
  that his apparatus is suggestive of a fried fish shop. In working with
  these lamps it is difficult to avoid a dark streak down the centre of the
  sheet, representing the space between the two centre wicks; to a certain
  extent this can be obviated by adjusting the reflector, and in any case
  is not very obvious when the slide is in place. Lamps constructed with
  either three or five wicks are better in this respect, but the former are
  usually considered to be too poor in illuminating power, and the latter
  are apt to crack the sheet-glass ends by excessive heat.</p>

  <p><b>Incandescent Gas.</b>&mdash;Incandescent gas burners do not need
  much description, as they are practically similar to those in general use
  for house lighting. They may be either of the erect or inverted forms,
  the latter being preferable owing to the light being more concentrated,
  and a reflector is provided to increase the illumination (Fig. 2).</p>

  <p>These reflectors should be <i>spherical</i> and so adjusted that the
  radiant is in the centre of curvature, thus ensuring that the light from
  the reflector passes again through the original source. If this point is
  not attended to, we shall be dealing with essentially two sources of
  light instead of one, to the detriment of the definition.</p>

  <p>The same remark applies to every lantern illuminant <!-- Page 8
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span>which is
  supplemented by a reflector, and it is extraordinary how often it is
  neglected by the manufacturer. Of course the opacity of the illuminant
  destroys much of the efficiency of the reflector, and hence in the case
  of incandescent gas mantles there is not much real gain in making use of
  them, but with these comparatively weak illuminants every fraction tells,
  and the reflector does not add much to the cost.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/Fig02.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig02.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 2.--Inverted Incandescent Lamp" title="Fig. 2.--Inverted Incandescent Lamp" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Inverted Incandescent Lamp.
  </div>

  <p>In light the inverted gas burner is very little superior to oil, but
  it is whiter, slightly more concentrated, and freer from smell, and
  therefore to be regarded as preferable if a supply of gas is
  available.</p>

  <p><b>Methylated Spirit Burners.</b>&mdash;Incandescent mantles heated by
  methylated spirit are also largely used, and provide a light decidedly
  superior to gas and nearly equal to acetylene. Some arrangement must be
  made for volatilising the spirit and driving the vapour out under
  pressure, and the most usual contrivance is somewhat as illustrated in
  Fig. 3.</p>

  <p>In this apparatus the spirit is contained in a metal reservoir at the
  rear and air pressure is provided by a pair of rubber balls and valves
  after the manner of a medical spray. Sufficient <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>pressure having been
  obtained, the liquid spirit is forced into a vaporising chamber
  immediately behind the mantle, and a kind of miniature pitchfork, with
  its prongs wrapped in asbestos wool, is soaked in spirit, and pushed over
  the brass fitting of the burner in such a way that when lighted the flame
  heats the chamber and volatilises the spirit. The burner can now be lit,
  and although the fork burns out in the course of a minute or so, the heat
  from the mantle itself is thereafter sufficient to vaporise the spirit as
  rapidly as required. This lamp works exceedingly well in practice, but
  has one drawback, viz. that it is possible to obtain too much pressure
  and squirt <i>liquid</i> spirit through the burner, when it naturally
  catches fire and may even run on to the floor.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:46%;">
      <a href="images/Fig03.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig03.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 3.--Methylated Spirit Burner" title="Fig. 3.--Methylated Spirit Burner" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Methylated Spirit Burner.
  </div>

  <p>An accident of this sort is rare and usually harmless even if it does
  occur, but an audience is easily frightened, and hence this burner should
  only be used by <i>an operator with experience</i>. An altogether better
  arrangement is that made by Messrs. Hughes of Kingsland and known as the
  'Luna' Lamp (Fig. 4).</p>

  <p>In this burner there is no pump and no volatilising chamber; <!-- Page
  10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>the spirit is
  contained as before in a metal reservoir and a separate burner underneath
  is used to keep this sufficiently hot to both vaporise the spirit and
  provide the necessary pressure. The heat can be regulated by means of an
  adjustable sheath to the burner, and a simple safety valve provides
  against an excess of vapour.</p>

  <p>I do not say that an accident of the sort previously referred to is
  impossible even with this burner, but I have never heard of it happening,
  and the lamp is certainly the best apparatus of its kind that I am
  acquainted with.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Luna Lamp.
  </div>

  <p><b>Incandescent Electric Lamps.</b>&mdash;Incandescent electric lamps
  of the ordinary metal or carbon filament type are also frequently used in
  small class-rooms, and should be mentioned here, as they provide
  approximately the same illumination as a gas mantle, or in some cases
  rather better. It will, however, be more convenient to deal with the
  question of electric lighting as a whole in the chapter devoted to
  it.</p>

  <p>It will suffice here to say that lamps are made for the purpose with a
  special filament arranged to provide a concentrated light, the ordinary
  type being almost useless in this respect, and that small battery lamps,
  worked by a suitable accumulator, can also be used, but except under very
  special circumstances are hardly worth the trouble of keeping the
  batteries charged.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="cenhead">ACETYLENE</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that at present acetylene holds second place to
  electric light in popularity for optical lantern work. The light is good;
  not, it is true, <i>so</i> good as limelight or the electric arc, but
  still sufficient for a picture up to 12 feet in diameter at a working
  distance from the screen of not more than 30 feet, and this suffices for
  the large majority of halls.</p>

  <p>It has great advantages over limelight in convenience and cheapness,
  although on both these points it must yield place to the electric arc,
  always providing that current is available, and therefore it is chiefly
  used in country districts and in gas-lit halls in large towns.</p>

  <p>Acetylene gas is formed, as is well known, by the action of water upon
  carbide of calcium, and the generators constructed for lantern work are
  essentially the same in construction as for other purposes.</p>

  <p>The alterations introduced are chiefly directed towards obtaining a
  light as <i>steady</i> as possible from a comparatively small generator,
  and, secondly, towards the entire elimination of smell, which obviously
  is far more serious in a lecture hall than, for instance, on a motor car.
  The generators in most common use may be divided into two classes, i.e.
  those on the gasometer principle in which the carbide is gradually
  lowered into the water, and those in which the water is allowed slowly to
  gain access to the carbide. A good example of the former is perhaps that
  made by Messrs. Moss of Birmingham, though there are several others
  equally good, and clear and explicit directions for working should be
  supplied by the makers. The Moss Generator (Fig. 5) consists of a tall
  iron vessel A fitted with a gas tap at bottom, this communicating <!--
  Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>with a
  vertical iron tube within the vessel. Into this container fits the inner
  bell or container B, divided internally into two concentric portions
  entirely separated from each other, but connected by the pipe <span
  class="scac">P P</span> and the tap <span class="scac">T</span>.</p>

  <p>A guide inside the bell encircles the iron tube in the outer tank and
  prevents rotation. Into the inner portion fits again the
  carbide-container (shown separately on the left), which is locked when in
  place by giving it a half turn, when a hook inside the bell engages with
  the lower edge of the carbide container and prevents it from falling.</p>

  <p>The carbide container is fitted with a series of shelves, and the
  contents of a 2 lb. tin of carbide should be roughly divided among them;
  there is no need to make any accurate division. The carbide used should
  be that known as ½ inch mesh, and should be <i>pure</i>. That described
  as 'chemically' treated is apt to give trouble by over-generation in
  these gasometers and should be scrupulously avoided.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;The Moss Generator.
  </div>

  <p>The carbide having been placed in the receptacles, these should be
  closed by means of the loose flap and the whole pushed into the bell and
  secured.</p>

  <p>Water should be poured into the outer vessel up to a mark on the iron
  tube, and the bell placed in position. The lower tap being then turned on
  and the upper one closed, air from the outer portion of the bell can
  gradually escape by means of the iron tube and lower tap, and the bell
  gradually sinks by its own weight until it is on the bottom, but still
  <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>no
  water can reach the carbide, the air imprisoned in the inner portion of
  the bell effectually excluding it.</p>

  <p>The lower tap should now be connected by means of india-rubber or
  flexible metallic tubing to the burner in the lantern (of which more
  anon), and the upper tap on the generator turned on, the tap or taps on
  the burner being likewise opened. The air from the inner portion of the
  bell can now escape by the pipe <span class="scac">P P</span> into the
  outer part, and thence through the iron tube, and out through tubing and
  jet, and as it does so water will rise in the interior and attack the
  carbide.</p>

  <p>In a few moments the burner can be lit; but the gas, being generated
  far in excess of requirements, and filling both the inner and outer
  portions of the bell faster than it can escape, lifts the latter until
  the carbide is entirely out of the water, when in a few minutes
  generation ceases.</p>

  <p>If the jet is left burning the bell will gradually sink again as the
  gas is used up, and should thereafter maintain an automatic balance
  without attention.</p>

  <p>It can be turned off at any moment by simply closing the taps at the
  jet or, better, the lower tap at the generator, when the bell rises
  sufficiently to take the carbide out of the water; but if it is required
  to leave the generator unlit for a considerable time, it is better to
  turn off the tap on the top first. This causes the inner portion of the
  bell to fill with gas which cannot escape, and as that in the outer part
  burns out, the bell sinks to the bottom and remains there, the gas itself
  imprisoned in the inner chamber excluding the water from the carbide. The
  exact arrangement varies in different patterns of generator, but the
  above may be taken as roughly indicating the action, and further
  information may always be obtained from the maker or dealer.</p>

  <p><i>Emptying</i> should always be done out of doors, as the odour of
  acetylene gas is most objectionable, and for the same reason rubber
  tubes, &amp;c., should be securely tied on, so that the slightest escape
  may be avoided. <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span></p>

  <p>If the exhibition has been a short one it will often be found that the
  upper cells have not been affected by the water, in which case they may
  be put back in the tin and used again, but it is not generally advisable
  to put in less than the full charge to begin with as the weight of the
  carbide plays a definite part in securing the smooth action of the
  apparatus. The sludge should be thrown away (it forms a good manure for
  the garden) and the entire generator thoroughly dried, otherwise rust
  will quickly appear.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:21%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;The A.L. or 'Popular' Model.
  </div>

  <p>Theoretically one of these generators may be filled and left standing
  indefinitely, but in practice it is not advisable, as the damp in the
  atmosphere is apt to produce a very slow generation of gas, sufficient
  often to cause a decided smell.</p>

  <p>Of generators which act by admitting water to the carbide perhaps the
  best known is the A.L. or 'Popular' Model (Fig. 6), this being, in fact,
  a pattern designed for motor-car head-lights, but which answers well for
  lantern work.</p>

  <p>Its exact operation need hardly be described here in full detail. It
  will suffice to say that the water gains access to the carbide by
  'creeping' up between two concentric copper cones, and in the event of
  over-generation the pressure of the gas automatically checks the
  flow.</p>

  <p>This generator is smaller than the gasometer pattern, and hence can be
  recommended for portability; but in my experience the light is not quite
  so steady, and the control rather less delicate, thereby causing on
  occasions a perceptible smell, especially if left standing for a
  considerable time.</p>

  <p>There are other types of generators, such as the 'Water <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>dropping'
  variety, in which the water drips on to the carbide, and the reverse, in
  which fine granulated carbide drops a little at a time into water; but
  these types are not very frequently met with and need hardly be
  described.</p>

  <p>It should never be forgotten that acetylene is an explosive gas and
  should be treated as such. Searching for a leak with a lighted match,
  though perhaps permissible when the operator knows his business, may be a
  dangerous proceeding when the contrary is the case.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Acetylene Jet.
  </div>

  <p>Acetylene burners are generally of the 'Batswing' type, and are as a
  rule four in number, mounted in a row with a reflector behind, each
  burner being separately controlled by its own tap (Fig. 7). An acetylene
  flame is very smoky, and care must be taken that the burners are not
  turned too high. A nipple cleaner, consisting of a fine wire in a short
  handle, can usually be obtained from any dealer, and is very handy.</p>

  <p>Acetylene gas can also be used for lantern illumination in quite
  another way, viz. by a blast from a blowpipe, in combination with either
  air or oxygen, on to a special 'Pastille' provided for the purpose, or an
  ordinary limelight jet can be used. These methods entail the use of
  acetylene <i>under pressure</i>, and are so analogous to limelight that I
  shall for convenience deal with them in the chapter devoted to that
  illuminant.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="cenhead">LIMELIGHT AND THE ACETYLENE BLAST</p>

  <p>The illumination possible with this light is almost unlimited, and for
  really large halls it is, as remarked before, the <i>only</i> substitute
  for the electric arc. It consists essentially of a blowpipe flame,
  composed of oxyhydrogen, oxyether, oxyspirit, oxy-acetylene, &amp;c., or
  acetylene air blast, heating to incandescence a block of lime, or other
  refractory material, and the essential feature is that one at least of
  these gases must be under <i>pressure</i>. Thirty years ago this was
  usually achieved by storing the gas in rubber bags, and obtaining the
  requisite pressure by means of heavy weights; but except in a very few
  outlying districts this method has now been completely superseded by the
  use of compressed gas cylinders. The earlier editions of this work
  contained very full directions for manufacturing gas for storage in bags,
  but it is so exceptional now to find an operator who uses this method
  that it seems hardly necessary to devote much space to it, and the same
  may be said of automatic oxygen 'generators.' The present work will
  therefore deal chiefly with compressed gas cylinders.</p>

  <p>Most elaborate precautions are now enforced by the Board of Trade to
  ensure the absolute safety of these, and any doubt existing from
  occasional accidents of years ago may be promptly dismissed. Humanly
  speaking, an accident nowadays <i>cannot</i> happen, except by such
  wilful negligence on the part of the maker or filler as would almost
  render the culprit subject to criminal proceedings.</p>

  <p>Compressed gas cylinders are painted a distinctive colour, oxygen for
  example being black and coal gas or hydrogen red; the screw connections
  to the pumps, and all nozzle <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>and regulator fittings, are made with a
  totally different screw and therefore cannot be interchanged; the
  cylinders themselves are bound by law to be reannealed and retested under
  hydraulic pressure at regular intervals; the steel itself has to be of a
  guaranteed quality; and, in fact, every possible risk is guarded
  against.</p>

  <p>The most usual sizes of cylinders supplied for lantern exhibitions are
  those containing 6, 12, 20, or 40 cubic feet, and are usually sent out in
  wooden or hemp cases.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:37%;">
      <a href="images/Fig08.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig08.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 8.--Oxygen Cylinder in hemp cover" title="Fig. 8.--Oxygen Cylinder in hemp cover" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Oxygen Cylinder in hemp cover.
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 8 shows a 12-foot cylinder in its hemp case, the approximate size
  without case being 22 in. by 4 in. This size cylinder will supply an
  average limelight jet for just over two hours. The extra powerful jets as
  used for cinematograph work or for illuminating a very large screen take
  a good deal more, but for the usual apparatus as supplied for ordinary
  lantern purposes this is a pretty safe figure.</p>

  <p>A 12-foot cylinder is therefore the favourite size for a lantern
  exhibition lasting from an hour to one and a half hours, as it leaves a
  fair margin for gas used in adjusting the instrument, &amp;c., and a
  20-foot cylinder will usually suffice for <i>two</i> such
  exhibitions.</p>

  <p>The price of gas per cubic foot varies with the size of the cylinder,
  being less for large cylinders than for small ones, and the cost of
  transit is also less in proportion&mdash;hence it is frequently an
  economy to hire a large cylinder and retain it for several exhibitions.
  On the other hand most suppliers charge a small rent if a cylinder is
  retained beyond a definite <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>time, so this is a question to be decided by
  each user on its own merits.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, of course, cylinders can be <i>purchased</i>, and the
  question of rent does not then come in; also gas is supplied a little
  cheaper in a customer's own cylinder than if sent on hire. If purchase is
  decided on it is frequently an economy to buy <i>two</i>, or two of each
  gas, if coal gas cylinders are required as well.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:37%;">
      <a href="images/Fig09.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig09.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 9.--Double Lever Key" title="Fig. 9.--Double Lever Key" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 9</span>.&mdash;Double Lever Key.
  </div>

  <p>The whole contents of the cylinders can then be used up without waste,
  as if a cylinder should become exhausted during the course of a lecture,
  it is only a matter of a minute or two to change over to the spare one,
  whereas the compressors are required by law to empty out every cylinder
  returned to them for refilling, and any remaining gas is thereby
  wasted.</p>

  <p>It is extremely tantalising, to say the least of it, to find the
  pressure gauge indicating that there is, say, 8 feet of gas remaining in
  a cylinder, and to be compelled to waste this or else risk running short
  for the next exhibition, and duplicate cylinders are the only way of
  avoiding the loss.</p>

  <p>The cylinders are filled to a pressure of 120 atmospheres, or 1800 lb.
  per square inch, and are closed by strong screw nozzles. The keys for
  opening or closing these are of three types, viz. the 'T' pattern,
  'Spanner' pattern, and that known as the 'Double Lever' type. This latter
  is so made that in closing the valve it shuts up to half its length and
  <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>opens out to double the leverage when being
  used to <i>open</i> the cylinder (Fig. 9). The idea is to avoid the
  possibility, which has been known to occur, of the cylinder valve being
  screwed down by a powerful wrist and defying the efforts of the
  despairing lanternist to open it.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:29%;">
      <a href="images/Fig10.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig10.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 10.--Fine Adjustment Valve" title="Fig. 10.--Fine Adjustment Valve" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Fine Adjustment Valve.
  </div>

  <p>Cylinder nozzles are unfortunately not yet standardised, but those
  most frequently met with in this country are those adopted by the British
  Oxygen Company, both oxygen and coal gas cylinders being fitted with
  corresponding <i>internal</i> screws &#x215E; inch diameter, those for
  oxygen being <i>right-handed</i>, and those for coal gas
  <i>left-handed</i>, and in each case terminated at the bottom by a hollow
  metal cone.</p>

  <p>As such an internal screw cannot obviously be connected to a piece of
  rubber tubing, some type of screw connector must be employed, and this
  may take one of three forms: (1) A simple connecting nozzle, (2) a fine
  adjustment valve, or (3) a regulator. The first is seldom used in
  practice for lantern work, for the reason that the direct pressure of a
  full cylinder (120 atmospheres) cannot be checked or controlled by a tap
  on the jet, as the intervening rubber tubing would either burst or blow
  off, and must therefore be regulated at the cylinder nozzle itself, and
  gradually readjusted as the pressure diminishes.</p>

  <p>To achieve this regulation with the ordinary cylinder key is
  difficult, though possible to a careful operator, but for a slight extra
  expense a combined nozzle and <i>fine adjustment valve</i> (Fig. 10) can
  be obtained, and regulation with this is <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>infinitely easier. The
  best plan of all, however, is to use an automatic regulator, which not
  only reduces the pressure so as to permit of the required adjustments
  being made at the jet-taps, but also maintains a practically steady
  supply as the cylinder empties, thereby obviating continual
  readjustments. Regulators are now so inexpensive that they have come into
  almost universal use, and are generally reckoned an indispensable part of
  a limelight lantern equipment. The form of regulator in most common use
  is that usually known as 'Beard's,' having been originally designed and
  patented by Messrs. R. Beard &amp; Sons, though as the patent has now
  expired it is open to any firm to make the same article if they
  desire.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/Fig11.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig11.jpg"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Construction of Beard's
    Regulator.
  </div>

  <p>The construction of Beard's Regulator is shown in Fig. 11. The gas
  enters from below into a rubber bag, C, from which it can emerge through
  the nozzle.</p>

  <p>Any accumulation of gas raises the bellows against the pressure of a
  spiral spring pressing it down, and this brings into action an
  arrangement of so-called 'Lazy Levers,' which in turn presses down a
  small conical valve and closes the supply from the cylinder, this valve
  re-opening immediately the pressure diminishes.</p>

  <p>The outward form of this regulator is shown in Fig. 12, <!-- Page 21
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>which
  incidentally also illustrates the usual form of connection to the
  cylinder, referred to later on.</p>

  <p>In Beard's Regulator the pressure at which the gas can be delivered is
  determined by the strength of the spiral spring, and can only be altered
  by changing this spring.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/Fig12.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig12.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 12.--Beard's Regulator" title="Fig. 12.--Beard's Regulator" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Beard's Regulator.
  </div>

  <p>In practice Beard's Regulators are supplied set to a low pressure for
  ordinary mixed or 'blow-through' jets and for a higher pressure (14-16
  inches) for 'injector' jets. At this latter pressure the rubber tubing
  used must be fairly thick and strong and well tied on, and even so the
  taps of the jet should not be turned entirely off unless the gas at the
  cylinder is likewise turned off immediately afterwards. The British
  Oxygen Company make a regulator which can be set to any desired pressure,
  but it is not quite so delicate in its action as Beard's, and Messrs.
  Clarkson also make a pattern regulator which is widely used and well
  spoken of. The attachment of any of these fittings to the cylinder is a
  somewhat peculiar one, as will be seen on reference to Fig. 10 or Fig.
  12. The regulator or nozzle ends at its lower extremity in a screw and
  cone, the latter being intended to make a gas-tight connection with the
  internal cone on the cylinder, and over this screws a loose wing piece
  with another outer screw, this latter fitting the thread in the
  cylinder.</p>

  <p>In making the connection care must be taken that the wing piece is not
  screwed too far down the inner screw, or the cone will not reach down and
  make a tight fit on its <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>seating; in its correct position the wing
  piece when clamped down should leave a turn or two of its thread exposed,
  in order to ensure that the cone does bed properly.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/Fig13.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig13.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 13.--Regulator and Gauge" title="Fig. 13.--Regulator and Gauge" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Regulator and Gauge.
  </div>

  <p>Care should be taken that the nozzle of the cylinder is free from dust
  before attaching any of these fittings: the best plan is first to blow
  into it, and finally wipe it round with the finger. Most professional
  operators <i>hammer</i> the wing piece home with a spanner or other
  convenient implement a barbarous method and really unnecessary if the
  cones are in good condition, but, nevertheless, almost always adopted in
  practice.</p>

  <p><b>Pressure Gauges.</b>&mdash;These are useful in determining the
  amount of gas remaining in a cylinder and are of a very usual type; they
  may either be screwed on to the cylinder before commencing to work and
  taken off again to screw on the regulator, or they can be supplied fitted
  to the regulator itself, in which case they can be observed during the
  course of the exhibition (Fig. 13). As the same gauge may be used for
  cylinders of different sizes (though <i>never</i> for those containing
  <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span>different gases), they simply register in
  atmospheres, and knowing that a full cylinder shows a pressure of 120
  atmospheres, the requisite calculation must be made to determine how many
  cubic feet are unused.</p>

  <p>In the case of oxygen cylinders an approximate idea of the amount of
  gas remaining can be got by <i>weighing</i> it carefully when known to be
  either absolutely full or absolutely empty, and re-weighing it when
  information is required. Oxygen weighs approximately 1.4 oz. per cubic
  foot, and this is easily detected by an average scale. Coal gas is too
  light to be gauged in this way.</p>

  <p><b>Gas-Bags and Generators.</b>&mdash;It has already been remarked
  that there are two alternative methods of obtaining gas under pressure
  for limelight purposes, viz. gas-bags and generators (the latter for
  oxygen alone: there is no good hydrogen generator that I know of). In
  both these cases the oxygen is generated by heating a mixture of chlorate
  of potash and manganese black oxide. In the case of gas-bags the gas is
  prepared beforehand and passed through suitable purifiers into a rubber
  gas-bag. With a generator the oxygen is evolved during the exhibition
  itself; but this method has never come into very general use.</p>

  <p>Coal gas or hydrogen is very seldom home generated; a gas-bag can, if
  necessary, be filled a few miles away and brought full to the place of
  exhibition, or filled on the spot if gas is laid on; or, failing this,
  acetylene or ether, or even methylated spirit may be utilised
  instead.</p>

  <p>The bags in use are placed between double pressure boards (if
  <i>both</i> gases are required under pressure) and weights sufficiently
  heavy placed on the top (Fig. 14), or with a 'blow-through' jet only the
  oxygen need be stored in a bag and the coal gas used from the supply
  main.</p>

  <p>Cylinders have, however, so universally superseded these appliances,
  that space is hardly warranted in fully describing them, especially as
  any operator wishing to adopt <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>the process can obtain full directions from
  any responsible dealer.</p>

  <p><b>Limelight Jets.</b>&mdash;These are of three general types, viz.
  the 'Blow-through,' the 'Mixed,' and the 'Injector.'</p>

  <p>Of these the 'Blow-through' is now very little made, having been
  largely superseded by the 'Injector' pattern, but, as there are hundreds
  in common use in this country, they cannot yet be regarded as a thing of
  the past.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Gas-bags.
  </div>

  <p>The exact design of this jet varies considerably, but all are alike in
  this, that a jet of coal gas is burned at the orifice of a more or less
  open nozzle, and a stream of oxygen <i>blown</i> <i>through</i> it on to
  a cylinder of lime which it thereby renders incandescent. Fig. 15
  represents the various designs chiefly adopted for this jet, that marked
  <span class="scac">A</span> being perhaps the most usual, though <span
  class="scac">C</span> is also frequently met with.</p>

  <p>In light-giving power there is not much to choose between the various
  types; probably <span class="scac">D</span> on the whole is the best in
  this respect, but so much depends upon the exact position of the two
  nozzles, and the <i>smoothness</i> or otherwise of that <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>provided for the
  oxygen blast, that exact comparisons are difficult.</p>

  <p>'Blow-through' jets are the weakest form of limelight as used at the
  present day, and may be taken roughly as some 50 per cent. better than
  acetylene, or in other words, sufficient to illuminate a 12-foot picture
  at a distance of some 40 to 50 feet; but their advantage is, or was, that
  they only required one gas (oxygen) under pressure, the coal gas supply
  being obtained from the ordinary house main.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;'Blow-through' Jet.
  </div>

  <p>This advantage is now shared by the more recently introduced
  'Injector' jets, which give a far better light, and have therefore
  rendered the 'Blow-through' type nearly extinct.</p>

  <p>The general construction of a 'Blow-through' jet is shown in Fig. 16,
  and it will be seen that a short vertical spindle is <!-- Page 26
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>provided to
  carry the lime cylinder, and that this can be rotated from the back by
  means of bevelled gear wheels, which at the same time screw the spindle
  up and down. A lime cylinder of the usual pattern being placed on this
  spindle can be rotated from time to time to expose a fresh surface, as
  that in use gradually becomes 'pitted' by the blast, while the screw
  provides sufficient vertical movement to ensure that a complete rotation
  does not bring round the same position again.</p>

  <p>Some arrangement is also generally provided by which the distance
  between the lime spindle and the jet can be adjusted. The exact position
  of this does not matter within a reasonable margin, but limes vary in
  size, and 'Pastilles,' and other substitutes for limes, which will be
  referred to later, vary still more, at any rate as regards this
  adjustment. The average distance which gives the best result is usually
  about half an inch, and once set need not be altered with that particular
  jet unless a lime of different size is employed; minor variations due to
  limes being drilled slightly out of centre, &amp;c., do not seriously
  matter.</p>

  <p>There is no accepted rule for colouring jet-taps in accordance with
  the cylinders, and although jets are sometimes met with painted in this
  way, <i>i.e.</i> red for coal gas and black for oxygen, it is more usual
  to find coal gas taps <i>black</i> and oxygen <i>bright</i>, or sometimes
  both black or both bright. Care must therefore be taken that the right
  cylinder is connected to the right tap on the jet, but there should be no
  difficulty in telling which is which, and fortunately any mistake, even
  if it be made, is quite harmless.</p>

  <p><b>The Mixed-Gas or Double-Pressure Jet.</b>&mdash;This jet is
  fundamentally different from the 'blow-through' form, inasmuch as the two
  gases are combined in one mixing chamber before combustion, and burn in
  their correct proportions at one nipple.</p>

  <p>It is usually stated that this jet necessitates both gases being under
  equal or approximately equal pressure, but this <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>is not literally
  accurate, and I have given many a lantern exhibition with one of these
  jets, using coal gas from the ordinary supply, and oxygen from a
  cylinder. To use a mixed jet in this way needs care, as a very slight
  excess of oxygen puts the light out with a 'pop' which, although not
  dangerous, is disconcerting, while the light obtained under these
  conditions is very little better than with a 'blow-through' jet, and far
  inferior to the 'Injector' jets to be described next.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The mixed-gas jet is intended then to be used with both gases under
  pressure, and is the <i>only</i> jet to be seriously <!-- Page 28
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>considered in
  cases where a really powerful light is required. The power of this jet is
  indeed almost unlimited, and those made with large bores, such for
  example as used for cinematograph work, provide a light amounting often
  to some two or three thousand candles, and consume an enormous amount of
  gas; but the ordinary pattern, with a nipple of one-twentieth to
  one-sixteenth of an inch bore, and using some 5 feet of each gas per
  hour, or perhaps slightly more for the coal gas, will suffice for all
  ordinary work.</p>

      alt="Fig. 19.--Mixing Chamber of Jet" title="Fig. 19.--Mixing Chamber of Jet" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Mixing Chamber of Jet.
  </div>

  <p>The mixed-gas jet, like the 'blow-through,' is made in many forms, but
  these may be roughly divided into two main types, viz. those with small
  mixing chambers immediately below the nipple (Fig. 17), and those with
  larger chambers in the horizontal part of the jet as in the 'Gwyer'
  pattern (Fig. 18).</p>

  <p>The construction of the mixing chamber itself varies also, but that
  advocated by my father, the original author of this work, is generally
  followed, the chamber being packed with alternate discs pierced as in
  Fig. 19, which ensures a thorough mixture of the gases. A layer or two of
  gauze is often introduced as well by way of further improvement. The
  distance between the lime and nipple is much less than with the
  'blow-through' jet, and the adjustment has to be more exactly made. About
  &#x215B; inch is approximately correct for a jet of moderate power, and
  rather more for a bigger bore; also care must be taken to turn the lime
  frequently, as the latter 'pits' pretty quickly with these jets, and if
  it is neglected the jet may spurt back out of the hole, which is
  gradually formed, and crack the condenser. <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span></p>

  <p>There is still an erroneous opinion extant that these jets are
  dangerous, and if the operator is working with the now obsolete gas-bags
  it is certainly a fact that an accident in careless hands is
  <i>possible</i>; but with cylinders there is, so far as I know, no
  possibility even of an accident under ordinary conditions.</p>

  <p>It is true that if too much oxygen is turned on the jet may suddenly
  go out with a loud snap or pop, and this is in reality a miniature
  explosion in the mixing chamber; but it can in any case hardly be serious
  enough to matter, though I have found after such a snap that the gauze
  packing, inside the chamber above referred to, has been pierced right
  through, and, when first lit afterwards, the jet has for a few minutes
  burnt with a characteristic green flame, denoting the presence in the gas
  of fine copper or brass particles.</p>

  <p>To obtain a good light with these jets, and in fact with <i>all</i>
  jets, great care must be taken that the nipple is absolutely smooth,
  otherwise the flame is bound to hiss. The simplest plan is to slightly
  roughen a suitable sized needle with emery paper and to burnish the
  inside of the nipple from time to time with this. Especially if there has
  been one of the 'snaps' referred to is it desirable to see that the
  inside of the nipple is thoroughly smooth and polished.</p>

  <p><b>Manipulation of the Mixed-Gas Jet.</b>&mdash;On this point there is
  not much to be said. A good hard stone lime must be used&mdash;'soft'
  limes are useless for this jet&mdash;and the coal gas flame should be lit
  first, and the lime thoroughly heated with this before the oxygen is
  slowly turned on. As the oxygen increases the flame will gradually
  disappear and the light increase, until it is at a maximum for that
  particular amount of coal gas. This latter can then be turned on a little
  more, and more oxygen passed to balance it until the jet begins to
  'roar,' when we are getting the maximum light for that particular sized
  nipple. When the two gases are, however, in the proper proportion to give
  the best light, there will always be a slight excess of coal gas flame
  visible playing about the lime. <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span></p>

  <p><b>The Injector Jet.</b>&mdash;This is essentially a mixed jet, and in
  outward appearance differs but little from one of the ordinary type (Fig.
  20), but is so constructed that the pressure of oxygen 'sucks' coal gas
  into the mixing chamber, and so obviates all necessity for the latter
  being under pressure.</p>

  <p>With this jet there is little or no danger of the jet 'snapping' out
  through a surplus of oxygen, as the greater the flow of this gas, the
  greater the suction on the coal gas side.</p>

  <p>The light is not quite equal to a good mixed jet, but very nearly so,
  and therefore this jet is deservedly gaining in favour every day.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:46%;">
      <a href="images/Fig20.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig20.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 20.--Injector Jet" title="Fig. 20.--Injector Jet" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;'Injector' Jet.
  </div>

  <p>One point must be noted: the oxygen itself must be under greater
  pressure than with the ordinary mixed jet if the best light is to be
  obtained, and therefore a special regulator must be used, or one of
  ordinary type modified (which can easily be done by the maker), and
  rubber connections must be securely tied both on to jet and regulator, as
  the pressure required to work this jet to advantage, while not enough to
  burst a rubber tube, is enough to blow it off an easy fitting
  connection.</p>

  <p><b>The Oxyether Light.</b>&mdash;This is practically similar to the
  oxyhydrogen, except that ether vapour is used in place of the hydrogen or
  coal gas. The method adopted consists essentially of passing a stream of
  oxygen through a vessel packed with some porous material (such as cotton
  wool or cotton gauze) which is saturated with ether. The oxygen <!-- Page
  31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>becomes
  saturated with ether vapour, and the mixture is then used in place of the
  coal gas supply in a double-pressure jet, an additional supply of free
  oxygen being still required through the ordinary oxygen tap.</p>

  <p>The arrangement is cheap, as it dispenses with the necessity for a
  coal gas cylinder, and effective, as the light is little, if at all
  inferior to the oxyhydrogen, but differs from the latter in this, that
  with careless handling an accident is <i>possible</i>.</p>

  <p>In competent hands there is no danger, and I have used ether
  saturators myself scores of times without one single contretemps; but it
  should <i>not</i> be entrusted to any chance amateur.</p>

  <p>The use of the ether light has a curious history. In the earlier days
  before the proper construction of ether saturators was understood, and
  gas-bags were still in vogue, it was largely condemned on the score of
  danger. Modern improvements in apparatus rendered it perfectly safe
  against anything but gross carelessness or bungling, and the London
  County Council and other similar bodies immediately supplied it broadcast
  to elementary schools (in disregard of warnings offered by myself and
  others), where it was often entrusted to incompetent operators or even
  senior boys. So far as I know no serious accident ever resulted, a pretty
  conclusive proof that the light is really safe, but in time the London
  County Council realised that the universal adoption of this illuminant
  was not advisable, and I believe <i>now</i> prohibit it altogether in
  halls licensed by them for entertainments.</p>

  <p>In time, no doubt, they will learn to adopt a sane policy between the
  two extremes, but at present the official attitude in many localities has
  placed ether saturators out of the running, and before purchasing one the
  would-be operator should ascertain that he will be allowed to use it.</p>

  <p>Ether saturators as made at the present day may be divided into two
  principal patterns, viz. those in which saturator and jet are combined in
  one piece of apparatus <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>which fits bodily into the lantern, and
  saturators which are used outside and connected by means of tubing to any
  ordinary oxyhydrogen double-pressure jet.</p>

  <p>Both forms have their advantages and disadvantages; the first pattern
  tends to become too warm from its position in the lantern and generates
  ether vapour too quickly, while the second has the fault of becoming too
  cold (owing to evaporation of the ether) and therefore not vaporising
  quickly <i>enough</i>.</p>

      alt="Fig. 21.--Gridiron Saturator" title="Fig. 21.--Gridiron Saturator" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;'Gridiron' Saturator.
  </div>

  <p>Writing at the present date, when manufacturers are slowly beginning
  to resume their normal occupations after the stress of war work, it is
  impossible to say exactly what models will or will not be made, but I
  will mention one typical example of each pattern as made in pre-war
  days.</p>

  <p>The first of these is the 'Gridiron' (Fig. 21), adopted largely by the
  London County Council in the days I have referred to, and certainly one
  of the best designed saturators ever put on the market.</p>

  <p>In the 'Gridiron' saturator there are three taps: two at the <!-- Page
  33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>rear and one
  in front, between the saturator and the mixing chamber. Between the rear
  taps is the inlet for the oxygen, which divides into two channels, that
  on the left passing upwards through the <b>U</b> tube shown in the
  illustration (the corresponding tube on the right is merely a dummy), and
  thence through the saturator and out through the horizontal tube and tap
  into the mixing chamber, whence the saturated stream of oxygen finally
  passes to the nipple, and the combination burns with a whitish flame
  closely resembling that produced by coal gas.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/Fig22.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig22.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 22.--Pendant Saturator" title="Fig. 22.--Pendant Saturator" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;'Pendant' Saturator.
  </div>

  <p>The other channel for the oxygen is to the right, down the vertical
  tube shown there (the lower vertical tube on the left is also a dummy),
  underneath the saturator, and finally coming up into the mixing chamber
  from below, transforming the white flame into an intensely hot blowpipe
  exactly as it does with a coal gas jet. The front tap controls the supply
  of saturated ether to the mixing chamber, and whereas at first a good
  stream of oxygen is needed to pick up enough ether, by degrees as the
  instrument warms in the lantern, the oxygen passing through the saturator
  can be cut off entirely, and even then the front tap must be gradually
  closed down to prevent the hot ether coming off too fast.</p>

  <p>There is a disagreeable feeling of 'sitting on the safety-valve' in
  doing this, but in reality the pressure is never likely to become great
  enough to cause danger.</p>

  <p>Of saturators for use outside the lantern the best-known is probably
  the 'Pendant' (Fig. 22). With this instrument the oxygen supply is
  connected to the inlet marked <span class="scac">A</span>; <span
  class="scac">B</span> goes <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span>direct to the oxygen tap of any ordinary
  mixed-gas jet; while <span class="scac">C</span>, from whence issues the
  saturated stream, is connected to the coal gas tap of the jet. Whichever
  pattern is used, the essential thing is to keep a good supply of oxygen
  well saturated. If the lime becomes incandescent without any free oxygen,
  or it is found that this requires gradually turning off, it indicates
  that the saturation is becoming defective, and to continue is to risk the
  jet snapping out. In the case of an outside saturator such as the
  'Pendant,' this may even blow off the connecting tubes with a loud
  report, though no worse accident is likely to happen, and for this reason
  an outside saturator should be placed <i>as close</i> to the jet as
  possible, so that the rubber tube may be kept short, and incidentally
  this keeps the saturator warm and accelerates vaporisation.</p>

  <p>As ether vapour usually contains a certain amount of moisture which
  does not vaporise to any great extent, this gradually accumulates and the
  capacity of the instrument becomes reduced. It is therefore usually
  necessary to return a saturator to the makers every now and again for
  repacking.</p>

  <p>The only real danger with a modern saturator is not in using but in
  <i>filling</i>. This should be done if possible in the open air, and at
  any rate never near a light. Ordinary sulphuric ether of specific gravity
  720-730 is usually considered the best, and a quarter of a pint will keep
  an ordinary small-bore jet going for nearly two hours.</p>

  <p>More precise directions are usually sent out by the makers, and as the
  various patterns of saturator in use are pretty numerous, it would be
  useless here to attempt more detailed instructions for working.</p>

  <p><b>Oxy-Acetylene Jets.</b>&mdash;Any good mixed gas jet may be used
  with acetylene instead of coal gas, provided that it is under pressure
  more or less corresponding to that from an oxygen cylinder, and at the
  present day there is no difficulty in obtaining this, in civilised
  countries at all events, by <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>means of compressed or, to speak more
  correctly, 'dissolved' acetylene cylinders, referred to later on.</p>

  <p>With an 'Injector' jet there is no need for the acetylene gas to be
  under pressure at all, and a simple generator such as described on page
  <a href="#page12">12</a> will answer perfectly, though in practice very
  seldom used. With such a generator the pressure is so low that in many
  cases the jet will not even burn until <i>some</i> oxygen is turned on;
  but this introduces no real difficulty, as with a good 'Injector' a snap
  is practically impossible, provided the generator is large enough to
  evolve sufficient acetylene. It is far better in every way, however, to
  use the acetylene from a cylinder, just as with coal gas. Only in this
  case the cylinder is completely filled with a porous material, and this
  again filled with liquid acetone or other suitable fluid, in which the
  acetylene is dissolved as rapidly as it is pumped into the cylinder.</p>

  <p>To compress acetylene in the ordinary way is neither safe nor
  practicable; but these 'dissolved' cylinders are now used extensively for
  both oxy-acetylene welding and motor car lighting, and may be entirely
  relied upon.</p>

  <p>The D.A. (Dissolved Acetylene) Company were the pioneers in this
  country of the industry, and their methods of business are peculiar and
  ingenious. The user is requested in the first place to purchase a
  cylinder, and he then becomes the owner of <i>a</i> cylinder, but not of
  one <i>particular</i> cylinder. A list is supplied to him of various
  depots in the country where the Company's cylinders are stored, and when
  empty he can, on payment of a fixed sum, exchange his empty cylinder for
  a full one, which then becomes <i>his</i> cylinder <i>pro tem</i>.</p>

  <p>This saves the delay and expense of returning a cylinder to London,
  and incidentally clears the customer of any question of deterioration,
  this being obviously covered by degrees with each individual exchange.
  The system was first introduced in connection with the lighting of cars
  and only applies to the standard size for this purpose, viz. 20 cubic
  feet capacity, <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>but as this is, on the whole, the most
  convenient size for lantern work also, the limitation is not a
  disadvantage. The arrangement is also in vogue to a less extent with
  cylinders of 6 feet capacity (a size sometimes used for motor
  <i>cycles</i>), but the depots of exchange are at present far fewer for
  this size.</p>

  <p>The oxy-acetylene blast is much <i>hotter</i> than the ordinary
  oxyhydrogen, and therefore produces a more intense light. I have
  therefore used it with success on occasions when even the ordinary
  limelight would fail, and the choice has lain between an oxyhydrogen jet
  of enormous bore (and, of course, corresponding consumption of gas), and
  the oxy-acetylene.</p>

  <p>For this very reason great care must be taken only to use the hardest
  limes, and even then to use the lime-turning movement frequently, or the
  lime will pit or crack and a broken condenser follow.</p>

  <p><b>The Fallot Acetylene Light.</b>&mdash;This light consists of a jet
  of acetylene under pressure, without oxygen, but producing its own <i>air
  blast</i> from the atmosphere by suction, much as the 'Injector' jet
  does, but the reverse way round.</p>

  <p>The light is better than with an ordinary acetylene jet, though not
  quite so good as with a 'blow-through' jet; but as it only requires a
  cylinder of dissolved acetylene, or even a 'Pressure' generator, it is
  fast coming into favour.</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of the Fallot apparatus is that, instead of providing
  a direct beam of light in the direction of the screen, it projects the
  beam <i>backwards</i> on to a concave mirror, and it is the reflected
  light from this that is used (Fig. 23).</p>

  <p>Instead of a lime is used a spherical 'Pastille' of peculiar
  composition, and before use each pastille must be burnt off exactly like
  an incandescent gas mantle, after which it is extremely fragile and
  difficult to handle.</p>

  <p>To use this illuminant one lens of the condenser must be removed, the
  curvature of the mirror taking its place, and it will be seen at once
  that the pastille itself will get in its own <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>light and throw a shadow,
  which actually happens, but it is hardly perceptible unless specially
  looked for.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A complete Fallot Air Blast Outfit, with cylinder, fine adjustment
  valve, pressure gauge and burner, with two spare pastilles, is shown in
  Fig. 24, but if preferred a regulator, such as previously described for
  oxygen, can be used instead of the fine adjustment valve.</p>

<p><!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span></p>

  <p><b>Fallot Oxy-Acetylene Blast.</b>&mdash;This is similar to the
  foregoing, utilising oxygen from a cylinder instead of air, and the light
  is equal to a powerful limelight, and may be considered as an efficient
  substitute, though for <i>long range</i> work the shadow before alluded
  to becomes more noticeable (for optical reasons which need not be here
  discussed). The Fallot Company also make a special 'Pressure Generator'
  which can be used instead of a D.A. Cylinder; but my experience of this
  so far is that, although perfectly safe, the blast from it is a little
  unsteady as compared with a cylinder.</p>

  <p><b>Limes and Accessories.</b>&mdash;Limes for Optical Lantern work are
  usually supplied in the form of cylinders, the 'ordinary' size being
  &#x215E; inch in diameter and about 1½ inches long, with a hole drilled
  longitudinally to take the lime pin. Extra large limes up to 2 inches in
  diameter are supplied for more powerful jets.</p>

  <p>So-called 'soft' limes used to be recommended for 'blow-through' jets
  as giving a better light than 'hard' limes, but the advantage, if any, is
  very little, and these limes are now very seldom heard of, possibly
  because 'blow-through' jets themselves are becoming less and less used,
  and 'soft' limes will not stand the heat of a mixed or 'Injector' jet for
  long.</p>

  <p>'Hard' limes are turned out of the hardest stone lime, and must be
  kept in sealed tins until used, as they rapidly disintegrate when exposed
  to the air. There are one or two quarries known to provide the best lime
  for lantern purposes, and the various good brands on the market
  practically have the same origin as regards raw material, though called
  by different trade names; and the 'Hardazion' (hard as iron) limes,
  placed on the market some years ago by a well-known wholesale firm, to be
  countered shortly after by the 'Hardastil' (harder still) brand, are, I
  take it, legitimate though amusing instances of phonetic
  advertisement.</p>

  <p>Even the best of limes is liable to crack under the heat <!-- Page 39
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>of a powerful
  jet, and so a pair of lime-tongs should always be provided, and there is
  nothing better than the simple form shown in Fig. 25, and which is, or
  should be, sold by all dealers.</p>

  <p><b>Substitutes for Limes.</b>&mdash;A good substitute for lime, that
  will give the same light, stand heat equally as well, and <i>not</i>
  deteriorate if exposed to the atmosphere, has long been sought for, and
  some of the more recently discovered refractory materials are more or
  less satisfactory. 'Mabor' limes, for example, belong to this class, and
  so do some of the 'pastilles,' which before the war came chiefly from
  France and to a less extent from Germany.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE ELECTRIC LIGHT</p>

  <p>The electric current provides <i>the</i> light for an optical lantern,
  though it may take various forms, such as the incandescent glow-lamp in
  some shape or other, the comparatively new Ediswan 'Pointolite' lamp, the
  enclosed arc, and the open arc. This little book is not a treatise on
  electricity, but a few elementary notes may not be out of place, and may
  be of assistance to the non-technical lanternist.</p>

  <p>The first point then to be considered in adopting the electric light
  for the purpose of lantern projection is the character of the supply, and
  the information required may be summed up thus: (1) <i>E.M.F.</i>,
  <i>voltage</i>, or <i>tension</i> (these three expressions having exactly
  the same meaning); (2) <i>ampèrage</i> or amount of current available;
  (3) whether current is (<i>a</i>) <i>continuous</i>, <i>constant</i>, or
  <i>direct</i> (again three words meaning <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>the same thing), or
  (<i>b</i>) <i>alternating</i>. The E.M.F. or tension corresponds to
  <i>pressure</i>, to use the mechanical analogy of a water pipe, and the
  <i>ampèrage</i> to volume, and the voltage of the supply currents in this
  country are usually between 100 and 250 volts. Private lighting sets are
  frequently as low as 50, and current derived from accumulators may be
  anything from a few volts and upwards. <i>Power</i> currents, such as
  commonly employed for tramways, &amp;c., are usually about 500 volts, but
  the use of these currents for lighting purposes, though practicable, is
  not to be advocated.</p>

  <p>Ampères and volts are convertible terms in a sense; that is to say, a
  current of 10 ampères at 100 volts requires the same horse-power to
  generate it as one of 5 ampères at 200 volts, or 20 ampères at 50 volts,
  but they are by no means convertible as regards their <i>efficient</i>
  use for our purpose. The ampères used multiplied by the number of volts
  give the total power consumed in <i>watts</i>, and 1000 watts used for
  one hour represent 1 <i>unit</i> as charged for on our dreaded lighting
  bills. The current available from a public supply may be said to be
  unlimited so far as our purpose is concerned, and the amount actually
  used depends only on the total electrical resistance of our circuit, and
  this is measured in <i>ohms</i>, the three factors, viz. volts, ampères,
  and resistance, being connected by the well-known and simple equation
  C&nbsp;=&nbsp;E&nbsp;/&nbsp;R, C representing the current in ampères, E the tension or E.M.F.
  (electro-motive force) in volts, and R the resistance in ohms. The total
  current we <i>can</i> use, however, is limited by the size of the cable
  laid on in the building, and this is automatically safeguarded (or should
  be) by the <i>fuses</i>, which consist, as is generally known, of thin
  wires or strips of tin or lead fixed on a fuse board in an easily
  accessible place, and which melt directly the current exceeds a safe
  amount in ampères. Whatever method of lighting we use therefore,
  <i>enough</i> resistance must always be kept in the circuit to ensure
  <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>that no more current can pass than has been
  provided for, and in the case of an arc lamp this usually means a
  <i>resistance</i> or rheostat being retained in the circuit in addition
  to the arc itself, through which the current is passed and absolutely
  wasted, though fortunately the waste in money is negligible, and for
  reasons to be discussed later such a resistance is necessary with an
  optical lantern arc lamp in any case.</p>

  <p>In the case of a glow-lamp, the entire resistance is provided by the
  filament of the lamp itself, and that is why an ordinary metal or carbon
  filament lamp, for say 200 volts, has to be manufactured with an
  extremely long and slender, and therefore fragile, filament, while with
  an ordinary pocket-torch, which is usually supplied with current from a
  dry battery of some 3 or 4 volts only, the filament can be short and
  thick.</p>

  <p>Speaking generally, glow-lamps on a low voltage current can be made
  more efficient than on a high one, and are also longer lived for very
  obvious reasons; but, on the other hand, the transmission of current over
  long distances is cheaper the higher the tension, as for a given number
  of watts the ampèrage is less, and therefore smaller cables can be
  employed. On the whole, then, currents of 200 to 250 volts have during
  recent years become more common than 100, in spite of greater
  difficulties in making the lamps; but occasionally one finds a hall where
  two or more lamps are wired in <i>series</i>, two 100-volt lamps for
  example being wired together in series on a 200-volt circuit. If we are
  using current for our lantern from an ordinary lamp socket, this is a
  possibility that must be borne in mind.</p>

  <p>The same considerations, viz. the economy of transmitting power at
  high tension and of <i>using</i> it at a lower one, have been mainly
  responsible for the rapidly increasing number of alternating current
  circuits now met with, especially in sparsely populated districts. An
  alternating current main is one in which the current reverses its
  direction, usually in this country 50, but sometimes 60, 80, 90, or even
  100 times <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>per second (there being unfortunately in
  Great Britain no standard 'Periodicity' or number of cycles per second),
  and for technical reasons which need not be entered upon here, with these
  alternating currents the tension and ampèrage can be mutually converted
  by means of <i>transformers</i>, so that current can be transmitted at so
  high a tension, for instance, as 10,000 volts, and used at a voltage of
  50 or 100 or whatever is required, the ampèrage available being increased
  in inverse ratio as the tension is decreased. The same ready power of
  transformation unfortunately does not apply to the continuous current, or
  alternating currents would probably never have been heard of, but as it
  is they are very common. For glow-lamps it is immaterial which current is
  available, but for arc lamps the continuous is much to be preferred,
  though both can be utilised.</p>

  <p>With these initial remarks, I will now take in order of illumination
  the various methods of utilising the electric current for optical lantern
  work.</p>

  <p><b>The Electric Glow-Lamp.</b>&mdash;The ordinary metal filament lamp
  is not very suitable for lantern work, the light not being sufficiently
  concentrated, but from what has already been said, it will be evident
  that this method of lighting is more suitable where currents of low
  voltage are available.</p>

  <p>An extremely good and intense light can be obtained from a
  comparatively small battery of accumulators, which can easily be carried
  in the hand, and a short and thick metal filament lamp, similar to those
  supplied with a powerful electric torch; and this arrangement is actually
  used to some extent by travelling lecturers, but the mess and trouble of
  keeping the accumulators in order have prevented the method being
  generally adopted.</p>

  <p>When <i>alternating</i> current is available such a lamp will work
  well with a transformer to step down the voltage to the required degree,
  and the arrangement is simple, cheap, and efficient, and produces a light
  at least equal to that from <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>acetylene. In comparatively small halls,
  where the current is alternating, this is undoubtedly the best method of
  working, as it is simpler than the arc and amply brilliant enough for all
  practical purposes.</p>

  <p>With the continuous current the problem is not so simple, as
  transformation of voltage is not an easy matter, and a glow-lamp on; say,
  a 200-volt circuit involves a long and fragile filament, which it is
  difficult to arrange in a small space.</p>

  <p>Many years ago the Ediswan Company produced a 'Focus' lamp for the
  purpose, with the filament arranged in the form of a square grid, and
  this lamp gave a light of about 100 candles, and was fairly successful
  for a small room. More recently the Osram Company introduced a similar
  lamp with a metal filament arranged somewhat in the form of a cone, and
  this lamp also sufficed for a small class-room. It was, I believe, made
  in Germany and was practically unobtainable during the war. I understand
  the Osram Company are at present arranging to manufacture it in this
  country, but up to the time of writing it has not made its
  appearance.</p>

  <p>None of these lamps worked direct on a public lighting circuit can be
  regarded as really satisfactory, as it has been found impossible so far
  to get a <i>concentrated</i> light; the 100-volt lamps have, of course,
  been superior to those made for 200 or 250, but they are all for lantern
  purposes far behind low voltage lamps, which are really good when a
  suitable current can be obtained.</p>

  <p><b>The Pointolite Lamp.</b>&mdash;This lamp produced by the Ediswan
  Company is in reality a miniature arc with tungsten electrodes in a
  highly exhausted vacuum bulb. To attempt a technical description would be
  beyond the scope of this book; it will suffice to say that the action
  depends upon the same principle as the various wireless vacuum valves or
  the Coolidge X-ray tube.</p>

  <p>This lamp requires a peculiar starting device which is supplied with
  it, and gives a good, intense, and concentrated <!-- Page 44 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>light, not equal to the
  ordinary arc or to limelight, but comparing well with any other form of
  illuminant. It can only be used with the continuous current.</p>

  <p><b>The Nernst Lamp.</b>&mdash;This lamp at the present moment is
  practically non-existent in this country, having been made exclusively in
  Germany. Also as recent improvements in metal filament lamps have
  rendered it almost obsolete for ordinary lighting purposes, it is, I
  think, very doubtful whether it is still manufactured even in that
  country, and hence I do not propose to waste space in an extensive
  description.</p>

  <p>It will suffice to say that the lamp consists of one or more straight
  rods or filaments of a refractory material, which are semi-conducting to
  the electric current when hot, but non-conducting when cold. To commence
  with the filament must be heated, and in the lamps as supplied for
  lantern work this is usually done by means of a spirit lamp, which can be
  removed immediately the current begins to pass, as the filament is
  thereafter maintained at a white heat automatically.</p>

  <p>A three-filament Nernst lamp gives as much as 1000 candles, but it is
  extremely hot, and the light rather diffuse. The filaments are also very
  fragile, so on the whole the lamp was never very much in favour; but on
  the other hand it consumed very little current, and could be worked from
  any ordinary house lighting main, points which led to its adoption in
  certain cases.</p>

  <p><b>The Electric Arc.</b>&mdash;We now come to <i>the</i> light for
  optical lantern work, the brightest, the most concentrated, the cheapest,
  the easiest to work, in fact, the illuminant which combines all the
  virtues and but few drawbacks, but of course requires one indispensable
  condition, viz. electric current laid on. This current may be of any
  voltage from 70-250, or even higher; it may be continuous or alternating,
  though the former is to be preferred; and it requires a cable for <i>at
  least</i> 5 ampères, and for a large hall 10 or 12 ampères.</p>

  <p>The simplest form of arc lamp for lantern purposes is the <!-- Page 45
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span>hand-fed type as
  illustrated in Fig. 26. The essential feature is the pair of carbon rods,
  the remainder of the apparatus consisting of mechanical adjustments to
  'feed' these as they burn away, and to accurately maintain them in their
  proper positions and in the optical centre of the lantern. Just because
  the electric arc provides so small and concentrated a light, it is of
  extreme importance that the centring should be exact; and hence
  mechanical movements are usually provided for this which are unnecessary
  with other illuminants.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">
      <a href="images/Fig26.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig26.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 26.--Hand-fed Arc Lamp" title="Fig. 26.--Hand-fed Arc Lamp" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Hand-fed Arc Lamp.
  </div>

  <p>The whole question of optical adjustments has, however, been left over
  for a future chapter, as it more or less applies to whatever illuminant
  is used.</p>

  <p>The illustration shows a lamp arranged for continuous current, the
  upper carbon, which must be connected to the <i>positive</i> wire, being
  larger than the lower (the negative), and very slightly behind it. The
  light from a continuous current arc lamp comes chiefly from this upper or
  positive carbon, <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>which 'craters' as it is used, and this
  arrangement has the effect of radiating the light in the direction
  required (Fig. 27).</p>

  <p>The positive carbon is usually of the 'cored' type, that is provided
  with a core of softer carbon, as this assists the 'cratering' action,
  while the negative is generally used 'solid,' that is homogeneous right
  through.</p>

  <p>The arc has to be 'struck' in the first place by touching the carbons
  together for a moment by the mechanical means provided, and then
  separating them to the working distance, which is approximately &#x215B;
  inch. They must then be maintained at that distance by 'feeding' as they
  slowly burn away, and this 'feeding' in arc lamps for lantern work is
  usually done by hand, as in the lamp illustrated in Fig. 26, but may be
  done by an automatic arrangement, as will be described later.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">
      <a href="images/Fig27.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig27.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 27." title="Fig. 27." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 27.</span>
  </div>

  <p>The current is really carried across the arc by <i>convection</i>, or
  in other words conducted by a bridge of white hot carbon particles, which
  continually stream across from the positive carbon to the negative, and
  this bridge, while conducting the current, interposes a very considerable
  <i>resistance</i> (otherwise it would not of course become hot).</p>

  <p>A certain potential or tension is therefore necessary if a given
  current is to be maintained, and this potential has to be greater the
  longer the arc and also (though not in direct proportion) the smaller the
  carbons.</p>

  <p>When, however, everything is in the best proportion, <i>i.e.</i>
  length of arc, size of carbons, and current passing, the potential at the
  arc lamp terminals required is approximately 45 volts, and this may be
  taken as a fixed figure for any current.</p>

  <p>The length of arc to give the best results may also be taken <!-- Page
  47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>as
  approximately fixed at &#x215B; inch, and the <i>variable</i> factor for
  different currents as required is provided by altering the sizes of
  carbons employed.</p>

  <p>The error must not be made, however, of assuming that an E.M.F. of 45
  volts is sufficient to work an arc lamp, as the minimum in practice is at
  least 65 volts, and 100 or even 200 volts are advantageous.</p>

  <p>I have come across more than one private generating installation where
  the innocent owner has put in a dynamo for 45 or 50 volts, depending upon
  some carelessly written statement that this is sufficient.</p>

  <p><i>Why</i> a higher E.M.F. is required can be simply explained.</p>

  <p>Take for instance an average hand-fed arc lamp as used for lantern
  work and consuming, say, 10 ampères.</p>

  <p>Take also, as a fact, the statement given above that the necessary
  E.M.F. at the actual terminals of the arc lamp may be accepted as a
  constant at 45 volts, and reverting to the equation given on page 40,
  C&nbsp;=&nbsp;E&nbsp;/&nbsp;R, and substituting these figures we get&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Current (10 ampères) = E (45 volts) / R (Resistance of Arc).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is therefore obvious that under these exact conditions the
  resistance or back E.M.F. of the arc, as it is termed, must equal 4.5
  ohms.</p>

  <p>Now suppose the lamp left for a few seconds unattended, while the
  carbons are burning away and the arc is lengthening; in a very few
  moments the resistance will have increased, owing to the greater distance
  between the carbons, and we will suppose it to have become 5 ohms instead
  of 4.5.</p>

  <p>The current passing will now be 45&nbsp;/&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;9 ampères only.</p>

  <p>In other words, a very slight lengthening of the arc has reduced the
  current, and therefore the light, by 10 per cent.</p>

  <p>Not only so, but 45 volts being needed to maintain an arc of <!-- Page
  48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>normal
  length, it is insufficient to maintain a longer one, and in practice the
  effect of leaving an arc under these conditions to itself for even a few
  seconds is that it <i>goes out</i>, to the annoyance of the lecturer and
  the confusion of the operator.</p>

  <p>It is just <i>possible</i> to work an arc lamp with a total E.M.F. of
  45 volts by giving one's whole attention to it and never taking the hand
  off the feeding handle; but in practice no one with any experience would
  attempt it. The arc would almost certainly go out several times during
  the exhibition.</p>

  <p>Now, take an example of a similar arc lamp consuming 10 ampères but
  worked from a supply of 200 volts.</p>

  <p>Our equation C&nbsp;=&nbsp;E&nbsp;/&nbsp;R must then obviously become</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>C (10 ampères) = E (200 volts) / Total Resistance (20 ohms).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The resistance of the arc itself being the same as before, viz. 4.5
  ohms, it is obviously necessary to put an <i>extra</i> fixed resistance
  equal to 15.5 ohms in series with it in order to make up the total of 20
  ohms.</p>

  <p><i>Now</i> leave the arc unattended until the resistance of 4.5 ohms
  has again become 5 ohms; the only effect is that our current, instead of
  remaining at 10 ampères, has become 200&nbsp;/&nbsp;20.5 or 9.8 nearly, a
  difference which is imperceptible.</p>

  <p>This is not all, for it is an elementary rule in electrical science
  that the total E.M.F. of any circuit distributes itself along that
  circuit in proportion to the distribution of resistance.</p>

  <p>In other words, our original E.M.F. of 200 volts will so distribute
  itself as to reserve, so to speak, an E.M.F. of 45 volts for the arc,
  while the resistance of this remains at 4.5 ohms, but directly this
  resistance increases, the E.M.F. at the arc lamp terminals automatically
  rises, and therefore the actual diminution in current is even less than
  the figures above quoted. <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span></p>

  <p>Should the arc tend to 'break' or go out, the resistance across it
  automatically becomes infinite and the <i>whole</i> 200 volts is at that
  moment available to prevent the occurrence.</p>

  <p>Under these conditions, therefore, the operator can safely leave the
  arc for many minutes at a time. In carrying out experimental work I have
  often left the lantern, walked up to the screen, discussed results with a
  friend, and walked back, and the arc has shown no signs of misbehaviour
  whatever.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/Fig28.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig28.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 28.--Resistance" title="Fig. 28.--Resistance" /></a>
    Fig. 28.&mdash;Resistance.
  </div>

  <p>In practice any current from 100 volts to 250 volts may be considered
  as satisfactory for lantern work with a suitable resistance. Less than
  this involves feeding the arc rather frequently, and more may give a
  nasty shock, should the operator inadvertently touch a live wire, though
  I have worked an arc lamp on a current of as much as 500 volts.</p>

  <p>The <i>resistance</i> usually consists of a suitable length of wire of
  high resistance (Iron, German Silver, or those alloys known as Platinoid,
  Eureka, Manganin, Beacon, &amp;c., are most commonly used) wound in
  spirals on a frame, and is generally supplied adjustable (Fig. 28), so
  that more or less current may be used as desired. These resistances get
  pretty hot in use, and care must be taken that they are placed where they
  cannot scorch woodwork, &amp;c., and in cases where the lantern is a
  fixture it is a good plan to have the resistance bolted up against a wall
  once and for all. The resistance may be placed anywhere in the circuit,
  so long as the current passes through it, then through the arc lamp (or
  <i>vice versâ</i>), and back to the other <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>pole of the supply main;
  it does not matter in the least whereabouts it comes.</p>

  <p>In cases, however, where one pole of the supply main is
  <i>earthed</i>, it is a good thing to place the resistance in the 'live'
  side, as this keeps the arc lamp within 45 volts of earth potential while
  it is working, to the comfort of the operator should he touch a terminal
  or wire, though with an ordinary lighting main there is no real fear of a
  dangerous shock in any case.</p>

  <p>The <i>amount of current required</i> depends of course on the size of
  the sheet, length of the hall, and density or otherwise of the slides;
  but it is usually accepted in practice that the efficient light from a
  continuous current arc lamp equals 100 candles per ampère, and therefore
  a 10-ampère arc will give 1000 candles. This is sufficient for all
  ordinary halls and slides, but where these latter are very dense, as for
  example with the Lumière three-colour process, as much as 20 or 25
  ampères may be required.</p>

  <p>In these cases some special precautions must be taken for keeping the
  slides cool, or the result may be disastrous, but this is a question that
  will be referred to in a later chapter. A current of 10 ampères is pretty
  safe for all ordinary slides, and may be taken as the normal current used
  in large halls, though in arranging for the wiring it is as well to
  stipulate for at least 12 or even 15 ampères, especially as there must
  necessarily be a momentary increase of current at the instant the arc is
  'struck.'</p>

  <p><b>Varieties of Hand-fed Arc Lamps.</b>&mdash;The pattern of hand-fed
  arc lamp illustrated in Fig. 26 is only typical of many of the same
  general design, and there are others in which the design itself is
  fundamentally different. Of these the 'Scissors' arc lamp made by several
  firms deserves mention on account of its simplicity and cheapness. As its
  name implies, the mechanism resembles a pair of scissors, the carbons
  being attached to the ends of a pair of levers hinged together <!-- Page
  51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>(Fig. 29). In
  this lamp centring movements are usually dispensed with, the arc being
  clamped on to a tray pin as in the case of a limelight jet. This is not,
  of course, so convenient, and a further disadvantage of this pattern arc
  lamp is that the feeding process gradually alters the position and angle
  of the carbons. In fact, the one great merit of the lamp is cheapness,
  and where expense is an object, it should certainly be considered.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">
      <a href="images/Fig29.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig29.jpg"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;'Scissors' Arc Lamp.
  </div>

  <p>Yet another arc lamp deserving of mention is the 'Parallel,' a name
  again very aptly chosen, as the two carbons are either exactly parallel
  to each other or very slightly inclined. In the former case the arc has
  to be 'struck' by touching the ends of the carbon rods with a piece of
  metal or carbon. Of the actual manipulation of this lamp I have had very
  little practical experience, but I have heard it well spoken of, though I
  believe it has so far only been made for currents of 5 ampères or so.</p>

  <p>Yet another type which must not be ignored is the 'Right-angled'
  pattern (Fig. 30), a name again self-descriptive. The horizontal carbon
  is the positive, and the vertical the <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>negative, and this lamp
  again is made by several manufacturers in slightly different forms.</p>

  <p>This pattern lamp is in my experience the best of all for <i>small</i>
  currents, say, of 5 ampères or so, but inferior to Fig. 26 for currents
  of 10 ampères or more. This last remark perhaps hardly applies to
  <i>alternating</i> currents, which, however, I have not yet discussed. I
  cannot conclude this brief category of arc lamps without referring to the
  <i>enclosed</i> pattern, of which the 'Westminster' is perhaps the
  best-known and most popular (Fig. 31).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:49%;">
      <a href="images/Fig30.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig30.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 30.--Right-angled Arc Lamp" title="Fig. 30.--Right-angled Arc Lamp" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;'Right-angled' Arc Lamp.
  </div>

  <p>This is a lamp of the right-angled type, but the arc burns in a
  cylindrical glass chamber, not air-tight, but partially so. After burning
  a few minutes the oxygen in this chamber becomes used up and its place is
  taken by carbonic-acid gas and other products of combustion, after which
  the carbons burn away very much more slowly, and therefore require
  feeding at much greater intervals.</p>

  <p>This lamp again is chiefly made for small currents not exceeding 5
  ampères (and can therefore be used from any ordinary lamp socket), and
  for a moderate-sized hall is on the <!-- Page 53 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>whole as cheap, efficient
  and simple a lamp as any I am acquainted with. It can be supplied with or
  without mechanical centring movements as required, and is usually sent
  out with its own resistance for the particular current on which it is to
  be used, so that it only requires connecting up to the nearest lamp
  socket, and is ready for use.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;'Westminster' Arc Lamp.
  </div>

  <p>It is <i>not</i> sufficient for anything larger than a 12-foot sheet
  or for working at a greater distance than, say, 40 feet, but within these
  limits the lamp, and in fact <i>any</i> good 5-ampère arc lamp, will be
  found quite satisfactory and saves the expense of putting in a special
  cable.</p>

  <p><b>Automatic Arc Lamps.</b>&mdash;Arc lamps for lantern work in which
  the feeding is done automatically are also made. Like hand-fed lamps,
  they vary in exact design, but all, or practically all, are so designed
  that the carbons are brought together by means of springs or weights, and
  some form of 'brake' controlled by a system of electro-magnets checks the
  <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>movement. As the carbons burn away the arc
  lengthens, the current weakens, the electro-magnets lose their grip, and
  the carbons move together until the increasing current puts on the brake
  again. Some of these lamps are 'semi-automatic' only, that is to say, the
  arc has to be struck by hand, while others perform this operation
  automatically as well, usually by an additional magnet which draws back
  the carbons by the correct amount after the arc is struck.</p>

  <p>My frank advice to intending lanternists is to leave these lamps
  alone. Some of them are satisfactory up to a point, but they are all apt
  to be 'jumpy,' and on the whole the hand-fed type is in my opinion to be
  preferred.</p>

  <p><b>Arc Lamps on Alternating Currents.</b>&mdash;The alternating
  current is not so good as the continuous for lantern work with arc lamps:
  the light per ampère is not so great, the light has an irritating habit
  of travelling round the carbons and there is always a slight 'hum.'</p>

  <p>The sum total of these drawbacks is nothing very serious, provided
  that proper arrangements are adopted, and I have frequently manipulated
  arc lamps on alternating circuits with such good results that
  professional lecturers have at first refused to believe that the circuit
  really <i>was</i> alternating.</p>

  <p>As it is frequently stated that to obtain a steady light with an
  alternating current is impossible, I can understand their surprise, and I
  can also understand the statement in question, as the problem is usually
  tackled on entirely wrong lines.</p>

  <p>It is almost always stated that arc lamps for alternating currents
  should be arranged with the carbons <i>vertical</i>, and many makers
  actually so construct their lamps as to allow of this.</p>

  <p>To obtain a steady light under these conditions <i>is</i> impossible
  and I pity anyone who attempts it; but the statement that this is the
  best method of working has been repeated so often that it seems to have
  been taken for granted.</p>

  <p>The best arrangement (in my hands at any rate) is to <!-- Page 55
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>slant the
  carbons as for the continuous current, and also to have the upper carbon
  cored and the lower one solid, but to use a rather larger lower carbon
  than would be correct if the main were continuous.</p>

  <p>Also the upper carbon should not be <i>quite</i> so far back as with
  D.C.; to have the front edges of the two carbons practically in line is
  about correct, but the <i>exact</i> position should be carefully adjusted
  to obtain the steadiest light, and it will be found that a slight
  alteration makes a considerable difference.</p>

  <p>It is also a great help to have a weak electro-magnet, or its
  equivalent, so arranged that it tends by its influence to keep the arc to
  the front. On some lamps this is provided for, as even with a continuous
  current it is quite harmless and, if anything, beneficial; but, if not,
  any competent mechanic can easily fit an 'Induction Ring,' consisting of
  a single turn of stout copper wire, which has sufficient magnetic
  influence to do all that is required (Fig. 32).</p>

  <p>This ring must be wired in series with the arc itself, and as the
  current passing in it automatically reverses in synchronism with the arc,
  its effect is <i>always</i> to deflect the arc in the same direction, and
  care must of course be taken that it is so wired that the deflection is
  forward and not backward. This is the exact arrangement I have myself
  adopted, and I never experience any difficulty on the score of the arc
  wandering.</p>

  <p>Right-angled arc lamps, as described on pages <a href="#page52">52</a>
  and <a href="#page53">53</a>, are also very efficient on A.C. mains, and
  frequently these lamps are already equipped with electro-magnets for the
  purpose required. The 'hum' of an alternating current cannot be
  altogether eliminated, but can be reduced to a minimum <i>by reducing the
  voltage as far as possible</i>.</p>

  <p>As has been already said, the A.C. lends itself readily to
  transformation of voltage, and I find in practice 90-100 to <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>be ideal. More
  than this is inclined to be noisy, and less is apt to result in an
  unsteady arc.</p>

  <p>The arrangement, therefore, which I recommend from long experience is
  to employ a transformer to reduce the E.M.F. to 100 volts or thereabouts,
  and then work with a resistance in the usual way (if the original current
  is 100 volts, of course <i>no</i> transformer is required) with a
  properly constructed arc lamp fitted with an induction ring or
  electro-magnet. No difficulty should then be experienced in obtaining a
  good, steady, and fairly quiet light.</p>

  <p>Any little 'hum' remaining can be silenced to a very considerable
  extent by placing the entire lantern on a thick block of saddlers' felt,
  but in practice I have never found this necessary with ordinary currents,
  though a few abnormal circuits where the 'periodicity' is very high are
  noisier than others.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE OPTICAL SYSTEM OF A LANTERN</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:59%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 33a.</span>&mdash;Optical System of Lantern.
  </div>

  <p>As previously noted, the essential parts of an Optical Lantern are, in
  order from rear to front: (1) The illuminant; (2) the condenser; (3) the
  slide and slide stage; (4) the objective, to which must be added, (5) the
  body or framework which holds the whole together. Fig. 33 is a
  diagrammatic representation of the entire optical system and Fig. 33<span
  class="scac">A</span> shows all the various parts <i>in situ</i>: <span
  class="scac">A</span> being the illuminant, shown in Fig. 33 <!-- Page 58
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>as an arc lamp,
  <span class="scac">B</span> the condenser, <span class="scac">C</span>
  the slide stage, and <span class="scac">D</span> the objective. The
  foundation, so to speak, of the whole instrument is of course the slide,
  which, as made in this country, consists of a square of glass 3¼ inches
  diameter, the slide itself being somewhat less than this on account of
  the binding, &amp;c.; in making calculations it is usually taken as a
  3-inch circle. Slides are usually made by binding together with strips of
  paper or cloth two such squares, on one of which is the photographic film
  or painting forming the picture, the other being simply a plain cover
  glass placed over the slide surface to protect it, and between the two
  being placed a paper mask with an aperture of whatever size or shape is
  required, that of the aforesaid 3-inch circle being usually taken as the
  standard or normal dimension for this aperture.</p>

  <p>The slide being illuminated by one of the various methods discussed in
  the previous chapters, is focussed on the screen by the objective, which
  must be selected according to the size of picture required and the
  distance between lantern and screen.</p>

  <p>These points will be gone into later, and also details as to various
  types of objectives and their respective advantages; but it may be said
  here that a lantern objective consists usually of a combination of lenses
  of 2 inches or 2½ inches diameter mounted in a rackwork focussing system
  at a distance from the slide of 6 inches to 18 inches, according to the
  length of its 'focus.' As our slide is from 3 to 3¼ inches diameter, it
  is evident that all the light radiating from this cannot possibly get
  through the objective unless it is <i>converged</i> upon it, and to do
  this is the function of the condenser. The following two diagrams, Figs.
  34 and 35, will make the matter clear.</p>

  <p><span class="scac">S</span> represents our glass slide of 3 inches
  clear diameter, <span class="scac">R</span> the radiant or illuminant,
  and <span class="scac">L</span> our objective, shown here for the sake of
  simplicity as a single lens.</p>

  <p>The slide is well illuminated by the light emanating from <!-- Page 59
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span><span
  class="scac">R</span>, but it is obvious that the bulk of this light will
  never pass through the lens, and, in fact, only the very centre of the
  slide will under these circumstances appear upon the screen at all.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 35.</span>&mdash;Action of Condenser.
  </div>

  <p>What is evidently wanted is to <i>converge</i> these outer rays, or in
  other words to bend them in so that they also pass through the objective,
  and this is the function of the condenser as illustrated in Fig. 35. The
  condenser is here represented also by a single lens, but in practice it
  also is invariably constructed of two or even three lenses, for both
  optical and mechanical reasons. It is evident from the above diagrams
  that the condenser must be somewhat larger in diameter than the slide
  itself, and condensers for ordinary lantern work are usually 4 inches to
  4½ inches diameter. The former size <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>will suffice if the
  condenser is placed very close to the slide, but it is often advisable to
  leave a little intervening space, especially if the illuminant is a
  powerful one, in order to allow any condensation of moisture readily to
  evaporate and escape. Hence lanterns for long range work (which involve,
  of course, good illumination) are usually made with condensers of 4½
  inches diameter. Lantern condensers of to-day usually take one of the two
  forms shown in Fig. 36, but the exact curve must be left to the
  manufacturer, as the focus of the condenser must have a definite relation
  to that of the objective. Taking, however, the design of <span
  class="scac">E</span>, the most common of all, the two lenses should not
  be exactly similar unless the objective is pretty short in focus, or, in
  other words, unless the distance of the illuminant on the one hand and
  that of the objective on the other are approximately equal. If the
  lantern is intended for long range work, that is equipped with a long
  focus objective, the front component of the condenser should also be
  constructed longer in focus (that is to say, with a shallower curve) than
  the rear one, and it is amazing how careless manufacturers are in this
  respect. If, as is often the case, the lantern is fitted with several
  objectives of different foci, it is usually necessary to supply
  alternative condensers also, or at least to supply an interchangeable
  front component.</p>

      alt="Fig. 36.--Forms of Condensers" title="Fig. 36.--Forms of Condensers" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Forms of Condensers.
  </div>

  <p>If the entire condenser is too long in focus, light is lost; if too
  short, it is impossible to obtain an even disc, as there is invariably a
  dark patch either in the centre or round the edges.</p>

  <p>The mounting of the condenser also varies with different makers; but
  it must be remembered in any case that it gets <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>extremely hot, especially
  the back component, and hence the glass must be mounted <i>loose</i> in
  its cell, otherwise there is great danger of it cracking. Also the space
  between the components should be well ventilated, in order to provide for
  the escape of moisture which usually at the start of a lantern exhibition
  is deposited upon the glass, and should be got rid of before the actual
  lecture commences.</p>

  <p>Even with all care, the back component of a condenser will sometimes
  crack, though such an accident should be a rare occurrence; and hence a
  professional operator will usually provide himself with a spare lens, and
  the condenser should be so constructed that it can readily be changed,
  and with as little delay as possible.</p>

  <p>Condenser lenses as made in this country are usually ground from the
  glass known as 'English Crown,' and comparatively rarely crack; but they
  are very slightly green in colour. French condensers, on the other hand,
  are whiter, but the glass is more brittle, and a fracture a more common
  occurrence. The French variety are (or were before the war) cheaper and
  generally met with in cheaper instruments. More expensive lanterns are
  usually fitted with English condensers, as the tinge of green is almost
  imperceptible, and the advantage as regards greater security pretty
  considerable.</p>

  <p><b>The Slide Carrier and Slide Stage.</b>&mdash;Taking still the
  optical system of the lantern in order from back to front, we now come to
  the slide, slide carrier, and slide stage. The slide itself has already
  been described, and the carrier is simply a mechanical contrivance,
  usually of wood, designed for the purpose of readily changing the
  pictures and which in its turn fits into the stage of the lantern. It may
  be asked why, if slides are now always made to a standard size, the slide
  carrier should not itself be built into the lantern and form the stage;
  but the answer is, in the first place, that slides of a different size,
  <i>i.e.</i> American or Continental, <i>may</i> be met with, <!-- Page 62
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>and also that
  there are various mechanical slides on the market&mdash;for example,
  chromotropes or scientific models, such for instance as are made to
  illustrate the movements of the planetary bodies&mdash;and these slides
  are permanently mounted in wooden frames which could not be put into a
  carrier. The commonest form of carrier is that known as the 'Double
  Sliding' pattern (Fig. 37), which consists of a frame with two apertures
  for the slide, and an outer frame through which this itself slides and
  which fits the stage of the lantern.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:53%;">
      <a href="images/Fig37.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig37.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 37.--Double Sliding Carrier" title="Fig. 37.--Double Sliding Carrier" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 37.</span>&mdash;Double Sliding Carrier.
  </div>

  <p>This carrier, as will be seen, allows the next picture to be placed in
  position in the second aperture while the former one is being projected,
  and at a signal from the lecturer, the inner frame slides smoothly
  through the outer, and the slides are thereby changed. This carrier is
  simple, cheap, and quiet in its action; its one disadvantage is that each
  alternate slide has to be inserted from opposite sides of the lantern,
  and unless the operator is fairly tall this almost necessitates an
  assistant. Nevertheless, the carrier is the most popular of any, its
  other advantages, especially as regards price, being so great. It is
  usually constructed in such a way that the slide, as it moves out from
  the central position, automatically rises in its groove in order to
  facilitate quick removal.</p>

  <p>Another pattern deservedly popular is that known as <!-- Page 63
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>'Beard's
  Dissolving Carrier' and is shown in Fig. 38. In this ingenious carrier
  all the slides are inserted from the same side, the oncoming slide being
  pushed <i>in front</i> of its predecessor, and being therefore somewhat
  out of focus it produces a blur on the screen.</p>

  <p>The movement is performed by pushing in a projecting handle, and on
  withdrawing this the slide which is finished with comes with it, and the
  finish of the movement presses the new slide back until it is in its
  proper position and in focus.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:52%;">
      <a href="images/Fig38.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig38.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 38.--Beard's Dissolving Carrier" title="Fig. 38.--Beard's Dissolving Carrier" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 38.</span>&mdash;Beard's Dissolving Carrier.
  </div>

  <p>The entire action is simpler than it sounds, and the temporary
  blurring of the image on the screen during the process of changing is
  supposed to give somewhat the effect of 'Dissolving Views,' and hence the
  name 'Dissolving Carrier.'</p>

  <p>This appliance is three times the price of the 'Double Sliding'
  pattern, but the fact that it is worked from one side only is a decided
  advantage, though on the other hand it is not (unless great care is used)
  quite so silent in its action as the 'Double Sliding' type.</p>

  <p>A further modification of this carrier adapts it to take any of the
  recognised 'foreign' sizes of slides, so that if a few American ones, for
  instance, are met with among a collection of English manufacture, there
  is no need to change the carrier. <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span></p>

  <p>There are other varieties of carriers on the market which there is no
  need particularly to describe, such as, for example, carriers fitted with
  roller curtains to give the effect of a curtain rolling up, magazine
  carriers to hold twenty-four or more slides and exhibit them in rotation,
  and other patterns too numerous to mention. Of these the reader must be
  left to judge for himself, but, generally speaking, <i>simplicity</i> in
  a carrier is the most important point to be looked for, and
  complications, however ingenious, should be avoided.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Focussing Action of Lens.
  </div>

  <p>The lantern stage must also receive consideration, but it will be
  better to discuss it as part of the mechanical construction of the
  lantern.</p>

  <p><b>The Objective</b> is really the most vital part of a lantern, as
  the definition of the picture almost entirely depends upon the excellence
  or otherwise of this lens. This will be obvious at once when it is
  realised that the objective has to project on to the distant screen a
  greatly magnified image of the comparatively small lantern slide, and the
  intending purchaser is strongly advised to economise almost anywhere
  rather than on this item.</p>

  <p>The action of a lens in focussing the image is perhaps best explained
  by a simple diagram (Fig. 39), from which it will be seen that all the
  rays proceeding from any one point on the object are re-converged (when
  the lens is in focus) to a definite point on the image, and the
  perfection of the picture depends upon the lens performing this function
  accurately. <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>

  <p>The imperfections are chiefly two, viz. those known as chromatic and
  spherical aberration respectively. Chromatic aberration simply means that
  all the colours composing the original beam of, say, white light are not
  equally refracted or converged, and therefore do not meet again at the
  same spot (the well-known prism or lustre effect), and reveals itself by
  coloured fringes round the edges of the various details in the
  picture.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/Fig40.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig40.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 40.--Achromatic Lens" title="Fig. 40.--Achromatic Lens" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;Achromatic Lens.
  </div>

  <p>By spherical aberration we mean that the light falling upon the centre
  of a lens is not brought to a focus at exactly the same spot as the
  marginal rays, and a general want of definition is the result, usually
  accompanied also by a want of 'flatness' in the image, that is to say the
  edges of the picture do not focus at the same time as the centre.</p>

  <p>Chromatic aberration is easily cured by using an achromatic or
  compound lens made by cementing together two lenses of crown and flint
  glass respectively, as in Fig. 40.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the flint glass component by itself is a
  <i>concave</i> lens and therefore neutralises in part, or in whole, the
  convex crown lens. Flint glass has both greater dispersive power and also
  greater refractive power than crown glass, but fortunately not to the
  same <i>degree</i>; hence a compound lens made in this way and with
  curves carefully worked out may have its chromatic effect entirely
  neutralised while retaining very considerable refractive or 'focussing'
  power, and simple achromatic objectives of this type are quite
  inexpensive.</p>

  <p>In lanterns intended for Science demonstration, as distinct from the
  mere projection of slides, lenses of this pattern are very frequently
  used, as they will project the latter when required reasonably well, and
  for the demonstration of <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>experiments or of apparatus on the screen
  have advantages that need not be discussed here.</p>

  <p>For very long focus lenses also they are sometimes employed, as the
  trouble from spherical aberration is much less apparent with lenses of
  long focus than with short, and the difference in expense is much more in
  the former case than in the latter. For short focus lenses, however, as
  used in moderate-sized halls, they are not good enough, and the type of
  lens almost universally employed is that known as the 'Petzval'
  combination (Fig. 41).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:37%;">
      <a href="images/Fig41.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig41.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 41.--Petzval Combination" title="Fig. 41.--Petzval Combination" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;Petzval Combination.
  </div>

  <p>This lens really consists of two achromatic combinations, the pair at
  the front being cemented together, and that at the rear having an air
  space between. The combination is so designed that the spherical
  aberration of the one pair neutralises that of the other, and the result
  is or should be a lens corrected both for chromatic and spherical
  aberration.</p>

  <p>These lenses, however, vary very much in the perfection of their
  results, and as they are at present usually imported in bulk from France,
  the customer does well to insist upon a demonstration of his own
  particular lantern before acceptance.</p>

  <p>The magnifying power of a lens depends upon its 'focus' multiplied by
  its distance from the screen, and the focus in the case of a simple lens
  is easily determined by the familiar 'burning-glass' experiment, that is
  by focussing an image of the sun upon a piece of paper and measuring
  accurately <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span>the distance the lens must be away to
  produce the most concentrated spot.</p>

  <p>In practice it is sufficiently accurate to focus a distant window, or
  other luminous object, upon the paper, any error obtained by this method
  being for ordinary purposes a negligible one.</p>

  <p>With a compound lens, such as a 'Petzval' combination, this method
  does not hold good, as the optical centre of such a lens is not
  necessarily midway between its two components.</p>

  <p>The actual focus can be got pretty approximately by focussing a window
  or other object as before and measuring the distance from one definite
  point (say the front edge of one of the lens cells) to the paper, then
  turning it round and taking a second measurement from the <i>same</i>
  point, the mean between the two measurements giving the actual focus.</p>

  <p>In practice the 'simple equivalent focus,' as it is termed, of a
  lantern lens is usually determined by measuring the magnification of the
  image thrown upon the screen, when, by knowing the original size of the
  slide (a 'standard' slide of 3 inches diameter is usually taken) and the
  distance between lantern and screen, we get the focus from the following
  very simple equation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Diameter of picture on screen (in feet)&nbsp;/&nbsp;Diameter of slide (in inches) = Distance between lens and screen (in feet)&nbsp;/&nbsp;Focus of lens (in inches)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>or perhaps more simply still:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>{Distance between lens and screen (in feet) × Diameter of slide (in inches)}&nbsp;/&nbsp;Diameter of picture (in feet) = Focus of lens in inches;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>or, if we know the focus of the lens but want to know how far from the
  screen we must go to produce a given-sized picture, the formula will be:
  <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>{Diameter of picture (in feet) × Focus of lens (in inches)}&nbsp;/&nbsp;Diameter of slide (in inches) = Distance required (in feet).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is handy for the lanternist to remember that, dealing with a
  standard 3-inch slide, a 6-inch lens will <i>always</i> give a picture
  whose diameter is <i>one-half</i> the distance from lens to screen, a
  12-inch lens half this again or <i>one-quarter</i>, and a 9-inch lens
  half-way between the two.</p>

  <p>Bearing these simple figures in mind, the approximate distance can
  usually be <i>guessed</i> sufficiently near for the first trial, and then
  the lantern shifted a little nearer or the reverse as required.</p>

  <p>The following table may, however, be useful, as showing readily the
  magnification produced at different distances by lenses of given
  foci:</p>

</table>

  <p><b>The Diameter of the Objective.</b>&mdash;The diameter of the
  objective must depend to a certain extent upon its focus in the case of a
  double combination such as a Petzval. These lenses consist, as has
  already been said, of two achromatic components some distance apart, and
  for technical considerations, which need not be discussed here, the
  <i>distance</i> between these components is usually about two-thirds of
  the focal length. This is not a universal rule, as the lenses of
  different makers vary a good deal; but it is generally a fact <!-- Page
  69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>that the
  longer the focus of the lens the greater is usually the separation
  between the two lens systems.</p>

  <p>The entire lens therefore mounted in its tube resembles a
  <i>tunnel</i> of varying length according to its focus, and through this
  tunnel a <i>cone</i> of light rays have to be passed. It is plain,
  therefore, that a lens of long focus, which in practice means a long tube
  length, must be made also of large diameter, or a portion of the cone
  will be cut off, with a consequent loss of light.</p>

  <p>In practice lenses up to 6 inches focus are usually made of 2 inches
  diameter, and there is no advantage in a larger size. With a lens of 8
  inches focus there is a slight gain in increasing the diameter to
  2&#x215C; (the next 'standard' size), and lenses of longer focus than
  this should certainly be 2&#x215C; inches up to, say, 12 inches focus,
  when a lens of 3 inches diameter is preferable. These large lenses are,
  however, very expensive, both in themselves and also on account of the
  fact that their weight entails heavy and expensive brass mounting, and
  hence lenses up to 14 or 15 inches focus are often supplied in the
  2&#x215C; size for reasons of economy.</p>

  <p>To sum up, <i>short-range</i> lanterns, as they are called, are
  usually fitted with lenses of 2 inches diameter, and <i>long-range</i>
  instruments either with 3-inch lenses or the intermediate size of
  2&#x215C; inches. If a lantern is purchased for either long or
  short-range work, it is usually fitted with a brass front for a large
  lens, and so arranged that a shorter focus lens of 2 inches diameter can
  easily be interchanged, utilising the same brass mounting.</p>

  <p>Lenses of <i>variable</i> focus have also been designed, in which an
  additional lens can be added or subtracted to increase or decrease the
  focal length; but nothing very practical has yet been achieved in this
  direction, and therefore these 'Omnifocal' lenses have never come into
  general favour.</p>

  <p>Objectives like condensers want cleaning at times, and care must be
  taken not to scratch the glass, as the concave lens of each component is
  of flint glass, and very soft. A <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>clean chamois leather is the best thing to
  use, but a soft cloth, or even a handkerchief, may be employed with care.
  It is very important that a lens be reassembled, after cleaning, the
  correct way, as a single lens reversed would utterly spoil the
  definition. The front component is usually balsamed together, and
  therefore all that is needed is to see that the whole combination is not
  reversed. In the Petzval system this lens should have its convex
  constituent towards the screen (Fig. 41). The back combination is usually
  loose, and the two lenses are sometimes separated by a thin brass ring.
  In the Petzval lens the concave element should be inside, with its
  concave surface outwards, the deep curve of the other lens should fit
  into this concavity, and the flatter curve face towards the condenser.
  One or two makers, however, have introduced a modification of the Petzval
  system in which the whole of this back combination is reversed, and the
  exact arrangement should therefore be noted very carefully when taking
  the lens to pieces.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE BODY OF THE LANTERN</p>

  <p>We now come to the mechanical construction of the optical lantern, and
  a great variety of design presents itself, according to price, type
  (<i>i.e.</i> short range or long range), and the individual ideas of the
  various makers.</p>

  <p>Lantern bodies as a rule are now made of metal, although up till quite
  recently the better class instruments were more usually made of polished
  mahogany lined internally with iron; but there has of late been a
  consensus of opinion in favour of metal only.</p>

  <p>In the cheaper lanterns this metal body is usually made either of
  Russian iron or of sheet-iron tinned and japanned, <!-- Page 71 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>there being little to
  choose either in price or quality between the two varieties, and in all
  but the very cheapest instruments the front is usually of brass.</p>

  <p>In better lanterns the body is more often made of enamelled steel, the
  front as before being of brass; but brass, copper, or aluminium are also
  used occasionally for the body of the lantern.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:56%;">
      <a href="images/Fig42.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig42.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 42.--Hughes' Short-Range Lantern" title="Fig. 42.--Hughes' Short-Range Lantern" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;Hughes' Short-Range Lantern.
  </div>

  <p>In deciding upon the type of body to be purchased the main
  considerations to be borne in mind are: (1) The type or types of
  illuminant to be used, a powerful arc lamp for example requiring a larger
  body than is necessary for a weaker radiant; (2) the size and position of
  the lens to be carried, a Petzval objective of say 3 inches diameter
  which has to be supported at the end of a long brass mount for long-range
  work obviously demanding a body of greater strength and rigidity than is
  required with a 6-inch focus lens of 2 inches diameter; (3) price.</p>

  <p>Fig. 42 shows an extremely good lantern body for short-range work made
  by Messrs. Hughes, the illustration depicting the instrument complete
  with a 'Luna' methylated spirit lamp, though, of course, any other
  illuminant suitable for a small lantern could be used instead. <!-- Page
  72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

  <p>This lantern illustrates well one point that has already been
  emphasised as important, viz. the ventilation of the condenser. It will
  be noticed that this is placed <i>outside</i> the body of the instrument
  instead of inside as is usual with larger bodies, and that wide slots are
  cut in the condenser mount to allow free escape of steam.</p>

  <p>Other points of this excellent design are the screw adjustment to the
  slide stage (facilitating the use of special slides, such, for example,
  as those illustrating the movements of the planetary bodies which
  sometimes involve the use of extra thick frames) and a simple but
  efficient tilting arrangement to the base.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:52%;">
      <a href="images/Fig43.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig43.jpg"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 43.</span>&mdash;Long-Range Lantern.
  </div>

  <p>Such a lantern is hardly suitable for a powerful arc lamp or limelight
  jet, or for heavy long-range lenses, but is a very good typical
  instrument for use in moderate-sized halls, and a lantern of this general
  type is usually found in lantern catalogues, though, of course, the exact
  designs vary according to the ideas of the manufacturer. Of lanterns for
  long-range work a good example is perhaps Messrs. Newton &amp; Co.'s
  'Intermediate' pattern (Fig. 43).</p>

  <p>This again is only typical of many others by the various makers, but
  the principal points are common to all. These are: (1) The large and
  well-ventilated body; (2) the long <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>baseboard; (3) the strong
  and massive brass front necessary to carry the large long-range lenses;
  (4) the velvet curtain at the back to close in any stray light from a
  powerful arc lamp.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 44.</span>&mdash;Connections for a Bi-unial
    Lantern.
  </div>

  <p>The two foregoing designs are perhaps sufficiently typical of lantern
  bodies in general to make further detailed description of individual
  designs unnecessary; but reference should be made to features which
  special requirements may render advisable.</p>

  <p>Under this heading mention must be made of <i>Bi-unials</i> or Double
  Lanterns, as used for the once famous 'Dissolving Views.'</p>

  <p>A bi-unial lantern consists essentially of two different instruments,
  each complete with its limelight jet or other illuminant&mdash;front,
  condensers, objective, &amp;c., usually mounted on one body&mdash;and
  with some arrangement for 'dissolving' or turning the light in each
  lantern gradually on and off.</p>

  <p>Fig. 44 shows the back view of such a lantern with two limelight jets
  and dissolving tap, this piece of mechanism (shown below in the
  illustration) being so arranged that when the lever is horizontal
  <i>both</i> lanterns are on full, but moving the lever either way cuts
  off the gas supply to one lantern. In the case of limelight the tap
  should always operate by cutting off the oxygen supply in advance of the
  coal gas (in order to avoid a 'snap'), and the latter should never be cut
  off entirely, but a small bead of flame left to keep the jet alight,
  until the lantern is required for the next slide. <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span></p>

  <p>This is usually arranged for by means of a bye-pass, and a bye-pass is
  sometimes provided on the oxygen side as well, but is usually discarded
  in practice.</p>

  <p>A bi-unial lantern can be worked in the same way with acetylene gas,
  but with the electric arc it is impossible to turn the light on and off
  gradually, and in practice dissolving must be done by keeping both
  lanterns fully alight, and using a dissolving shutter, that is a movable
  shutter that covers each objective alternately. The same arrangement must
  be used with other illuminants, such as oil, only in this case the
  lanterns must be mounted side by side, on account of the tall chimneys.
  With oil lamps the arrangement answers fairly well, the dissolving fan,
  as it is termed, being made with serrated edges which give the
  <i>gradual</i> obliteration required; but with the electric arc the
  extremely sharp definition becomes a serious difficulty, and a good
  dissolver for this illuminant has never yet been found, though, in view
  of the fact that dissolving views are more or less a thing of the past,
  the matter cannot be regarded as important.</p>

  <p>The advantages claimed for a double lantern are two: first, a
  'Dissolving' effect by which one picture fades gradually into the next,
  and which is supposed to be more pleasing than the movement of a carrier;
  and second, 'Dissolving Effects' can be shown, such as exhibiting a
  landscape by day and changing it into a moonlight scene, or bringing on
  the appearance of a snowstorm, which can easily be done by means of a
  roller slide, with minute perforations shown in motion by the second
  lantern while the landscape remains on the screen from the first. In the
  days when dissolving views were all the vogue, a third or even a fourth
  lantern has been added for more complicated effects, and at the famous
  Polytechnic demonstrations of years ago, I believe that as many as six
  were sometimes employed.</p>

  <p>In these days of the cinematograph it is doubtful how far interest in
  such effects could be revived, and a lantern has <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>gradually come to be
  looked on more as an instrument for showing illustrations as required by
  the lecturer rather than as a pleasing exhibition in itself, and as
  dissolving views have lost their attraction, the double or triple lantern
  has been relegated to the limbo of antiquity.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:45%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 45.</span>&mdash;Beard's Circulating Water Tank.
  </div>

  <p>Among other 'special' lanterns should be mentioned models made with
  water-cooled stages, for use with very delicate slides. This elaboration
  is not necessary with ordinary slides and illuminants of moderate power,
  but where very delicate slides, such as specimens of natural colour
  photography, have to be shown, it is an advisable precaution to pass the
  beam of light first through a tank of water in order to absorb the heat.
  Lanterns intended for this work are usually constructed with a kind of
  double stage, a glass trough of water fitting into the rear aperture and
  the slide-carrier into the front one. Such an arrangement answers quite
  well for most purposes, but for extreme cases lanterns are equipped with
  a trough connected to a large outside tank and complete circulatory
  system, after the manner of the cooling tank of a gas engine.</p>

  <p>Such a lantern, constructed by Messrs. Beard, is illustrated in Fig.
  45, and it will be seen that in this instrument the water trough is
  placed between the lenses of the condenser. <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>This is a very good
  position, as the beam of light at this point is, or should be, parallel,
  whereas between the condenser and the slide it is convergent, and
  therefore a condenser of a larger diameter than the slide must be
  employed in the latter case if the trough is of considerable width.</p>

  <p>While dealing with 'Special' lantern bodies, we should perhaps just
  mention here the numerous pattern lanterns made for the demonstration
  both of lantern slides and of Scientific Phenomena, such as the
  projection of insect life or other microscopic objects, polarised light
  experiments, electrical apparatus, opaque objects, &amp;c. A detailed
  description of these lanterns and how to use them belongs to the second
  part of this work, as also does the popular cinematograph; but
  educational institutes, and even boys' clubs, when considering the
  purchase of a lantern, might well reflect whether it would be advisable
  to spend a little more money in the acquisition of an instrument which
  can be utilised for a variety of purposes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class="cenhead">LANTERN BOXES, STANDS, READING LAMPS, ETC.</p>

  <p>Having now discussed all the essential parts of a lantern, the next
  points to be considered are those of lantern boxes and stands. It is best
  to take these together, as more often than not a lantern is arranged to
  stand upon its box during use, and the plan is both convenient and
  simple. The whole question is one to be settled upon its own merits in
  each individual case. Sometimes neither box nor stand is wanted at all.
  The lantern is put away into a locked-up cupboard or other safe place,
  and used upon a permanent support or (as is often the case in a church)
  from a gallery at the back. <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span></p>

  <p>In most cases, however, a box of some sort is desirable, and the two
  main considerations are strength and simplicity.</p>

  <p>All patent arrangements, such, for example, as those in which the
  sides of the box fall down and provide trays for the slides, are
  beautiful in theory, but cannot be recommended in practice. A good,
  simple and substantial box is what is required, preferably painted black,
  and provided with strong handles.</p>

  <p>One addition may be permitted, viz. a tilting top. Some means for
  tilting the lantern is always advisable, as it is seldom convenient to
  raise the instrument to the level of the centre of the screen, and a
  slight upward elevation does not appreciably distort the image. This
  arrangement for tilting may be either embodied in the lantern itself, as
  for instance in the instrument shown in Fig. 42, or may be provided for
  on the box or on the stand, if a stand is used.</p>

  <p>It is, perhaps, an elaboration that may be regarded as not strictly
  necessary, as a book or two or other article may be placed under the
  lantern base as required; but a tilting arrangement is so convenient that
  it can be strongly recommended, and the addition is not expensive.</p>

  <p>For large, long-range lanterns a strong deal box, on which the lantern
  can stand, is usually all that it is desirable to purchase in the way of
  a support. A good solid table can usually be found, which will do all the
  rest, as it must be remembered that a slight tilt at a long range means a
  good deal of total elevation.</p>

  <p>Where this is not procurable a stand must be provided, and this for a
  large lantern should be strong and rigid. Anything in the way of a
  collapsible tripod should be avoided, but such an arrangement as Fig. 46
  is quite good and rigid enough for all practical purposes.</p>

  <p>For a <i>small</i> lantern a tripod stand is quite suitable, though
  care must be taken that one of the legs does not get kicked, either by
  accident or design, or the result may be a catastrophe. <!-- Page 78
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span></p>

  <p><i>Slide Boxes.</i>&mdash;On this subject not much need be said. The
  variety of patterns on the market is endless, some being designed from
  the point of view of safe transit by post, others for convenience of
  storage and classification. It is essentially a case where each
  individual user must use his or her taste, and in any case the question
  of the box is one for the owner of the slides rather than for the
  lanternist.</p>

  lanternist's equipment, and the most usual pattern is fitted with a
  candle, after the manner of a carriage lamp, or else constructed to burn
  colza or other vegetable oil, such as supplied for cycle lamps. Oil gives
  the brighter light, but is apt to get spilled in transit, hence a candle
  lamp is the more <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>convenient for a travelling lecturer, while
  oil is to be preferred if transport is not a factor to be considered.</p>

  <p>These lamps are usually constructed with a red flashing signal at the
  rear, actuated by a simple lever, by which the lecturer can communicate
  his wish for a change of slide, &amp;c., to the lanternist (Fig. 47).</p>

  <p>There are various other devices used for the same purpose, such as a
  castanet, to be held in the lecturer's hand and clicked when necessary,
  an electric bell to ring in the lantern box, &amp;c. If this latter is
  used it is usual to remove the gong, the buzz of the hammer being
  sufficiently loud without it. Some lecturers again prefer to use no such
  apparatus at all, but simply to say 'Next slide' as required, or to tap
  on the floor with a pointer, and the choice of a suitable means of
  communication between lecturer and lanternist must be largely a matter of
  individual selection. More elaborate <i>reading-desks</i> are also
  supplied by most makers, but here again judgment must largely come into
  play in what is hardly a technical matter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SCREENS AND SCREEN STANDS</p>

  <p>The best of all screens for lantern purposes is undoubtedly a smooth
  whitewashed wall, and this is now provided in many halls where lantern
  exhibitions are usual. In places where this is not practicable the next
  best substitute is a canvas <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>screen, which rolls up and down (Fig. 48).
  This can be obtained from any good maker, but again can only really be
  used as a <i>fixture</i> in the hall where the lantern is to be used. It
  can, however, be fitted into a wooden box which can be painted or
  varnished to suit the other architecture, and the provision of such a
  screen is to be strongly recommended whenever possible. If portability is
  required, a linen or calico sheet that can be folded up is necessary, but
  this can never be hung absolutely flat, and also loses a considerable
  amount of light by transmission.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 48.</span>&mdash;Roller Screen.
  </div>

  <p>A so-called 'transparent' sheet is made of very thin linen, and
  intended to work with the lantern <i>behind</i> it, showing the picture
  through the linen to the audience on the other side, but this is seldom
  used except in the open air for religious or political meetings,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>An <i>opaque</i> sheet can be had in one piece up to 9 feet square;
  larger sizes than this must have at least one seam, and most skilful
  sewing is necessary, especially with large sheets consisting of several
  strips sewn together.</p>

  <p>Sheets such as these are usually supplied with either eyelet holes
  round the edges or else linen tapes sewn on, and the exact method of
  hanging must be left to circumstances. <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span></p>

  <p>In the case of a small sheet it will be sufficient to stretch it at
  the four corners, and this can often be done by screwing into the walls
  or some convenient girder two screw eyes and similar eyes into the floor,
  all four being considerably farther apart than the size of the sheet.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/Fig49.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig49.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 49.--Portable Screen Stand" title="Fig. 49.--Portable Screen Stand" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 49.</span>&mdash;Portable Screen Stand.
  </div>

  <p>A stout cord being then passed through the two upper eyes, long enough
  for both ends to reach near the floor, one end of each can be fastened to
  the two top corners of the sheet and the latter drawn up, the two bottom
  corners being afterwards stretched and tied down tightly to the lower
  eyes. In the case of large sheets this hardly suffices, and it will be
  found necessary to fasten the sheet at intervals all round or it will
  exhibit awkward creases, and this again is a matter where the lanternist
  must use his own initiative according to the possibilities.</p>

  <p>In some halls the erection of a sheet in the way above described is a
  sheer impossibility, and in such cases a frame must be made by nailing
  strips of wood together, or better by utilising a portable screen stand
  (Fig. 49).</p>

  <p>These stands are usually made of bamboo, with short brass connecting
  tubes, and the method of using them is so obvious that a description need
  hardly be given. The screen frames are supplied by all the leading
  opticians, but an intending purchaser would be well advised to see one
  erected before ordering. I have actually seen a 12-foot screen frame
  offered for sale that was too weak to carry its own weight, let alone the
  weight of the sheet!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE PRACTICAL MANIPULATION OF A LANTERN</p>

  <p>Having now described the optical lantern in its various forms and the
  more important accessories, we come to the question of practical
  manipulation. In making arrangements for an exhibition the first thing to
  be seen to is to ensure that every accessory that will be required will
  be there, and the best plan is to make a complete list of all sundries to
  be provided. Such items as string (for the sheet), lime tongs if
  limelight is used, pliers for changing carbons if the arc is to be the
  illuminant, screw-driver, matches, the <i>key of the lantern box</i>, and
  other similar items, are likely to be left behind unless such a list is
  made and carefully checked. On arriving at the hall, the first thing to
  be done as a rule is to get up the sheet, after which the professional
  operator generally begins to feel happy again.</p>

  <p>The next thing, if it has not been done first, is to determine the
  position of the lantern, and this, as has been explained in Chapter VII,
  is a matter of the size of picture to be shown and the focus of the
  objective.</p>

  <p>It is a mistake to show too large a picture; a little 'white' round
  the edges is a good thing, and it is better to have a small disc well
  illuminated than a large one less bright. Convenience, however, must also
  be considered, and it is often justifiable to go back a few feet farther
  than other considerations would dictate in order to place the lantern in
  a gallery or other spot where it is out of the way.</p>

  <p>Having fixed the position of the lantern, it should be got into place,
  the cable or tubing connected or whatever else is necessary, according to
  the illuminant to be used. It should then be lit up, the flasher of the
  lens opened, and the light <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>centred sufficiently to produce some sort of
  disc upon the screen. (It is, of course, presumed that the lenses,
  &amp;c., have previously been cleaned.)</p>

  <p>A carrier should now be placed in the stage and a slide inserted into
  it, and the method of doing so requires a little explanation. The slide
  must be placed in the carrier upside down, as will be obvious to anyone
  who has studied Chapter VII, but in addition to this it must be turned
  the correct way, otherwise the picture will be reversed from left to
  right. This in the case of certain subjects, such as a copy of a picture,
  may not greatly matter; but in slides depicting buildings or landscapes
  with which the audience may be familiar, or worse still, printing or
  writing, is a serious blunder.</p>

  <p>Slides made by a commercial firm will usually be 'spotted,' that is to
  say, will have two white spots on the face of the slide when the latter
  is viewed in its correct position, and at the top. The slides should be
  turned upside down and placed in the carrier with the spots, of course,
  now at the bottom and <i>towards the condenser</i>.</p>

  <p>If a slide is not spotted it should be viewed as it is to appear on
  the screen, and then placed in the carrier with the face that was towards
  the operator as he viewed it turned to the condenser, and of course
  inverted.</p>

  <p>The above remarks apply only in cases where the image is thrown
  <i>on</i> the screen; in the comparatively rare instances where it is
  shown <i>through</i> the latter the slides must be turned round
  laterally, but of course still inverted. The slide having been placed in
  the stage it should be 'focussed' by racking the objective in or out, and
  if necessary pulling out the draw tube as well until the image on the
  screen is sharply defined. So far the light has only been roughly
  centred, sufficiently so to enable the slide to be focussed, and to
  complete the operation both slide and carrier should next be taken out of
  the lantern, leaving a clear disc on the screen, and this disc may
  resemble any of the appearances shown in Fig. 50. <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span></p>

  <p>If it resembles <span class="scac">A</span> the light must be moved to
  the left, if like <span class="scac">B</span> to the right, like <span
  class="scac">C</span> it must be lowered, like <span
  class="scac">D</span> it must be raised, always moving it to the side
  opposite to the dark shade until this is central on the disc. If it now
  resembles <span class="scac">E</span>, the light must be moved nearer the
  condenser; if, on the contrary, the centre is dark, it must be drawn back
  until finally the circle should be as nearly as possible clear and bright
  all over, as at <span class="scac">F</span>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/Fig50.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/Fig50.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 50.--Adjustment of the Light" title="Fig. 50.--Adjustment of the Light" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 50.</span>&mdash;Adjustment of the Light.
  </div>

  <p>It is important to note that this adjustment <i>cannot</i> be properly
  made while a slide is in position, and neither can it be made until the
  lantern has been focussed, so the above procedure is the only way to get
  a satisfactory result. With some of the larger illuminants, such as a
  paraffin-oil lamp, there are no centering adjustments, the size of the
  radiant rendering exact centering unnecessary, and generally speaking the
  smaller the luminous point, the more exact must the operation be.</p>

  <p>In the case of such illuminants as acetylene or limelight <!-- Page 85
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>care must be
  taken that they are turned fully on before centering, otherwise turning
  on the fuller amount afterwards will raise the position of the luminous
  spot.</p>

  <p>The centering achieved, the slide carrier may be replaced, the first
  slides placed in position, the remainder arranged in their proper order,
  the system of signalling with the lecturer determined, and all is
  ready.</p>

  <p>If there is still an interval before commencing, the light may be
  switched off or turned out, or in the case say of limelight, turned down
  very low until wanted.</p>

  <p>It is of extreme importance to see that all the slides are in their
  right order, though the duty of seeing to this usually rests with the
  lecturer rather than with the operator. I remember hearing of one lecture
  on the life of Queen Victoria, when the lecturer announced, 'The next
  picture will be a photograph of the Royal Prince who for many years
  shared the Throne with our gracious Sovereign.' At the words the operator
  brought on the next slide, which proved to be <i>a restored specimen of a
  prehistoric monster</i> (tableaux!). Such mistakes 'bring down the
  house,' but in serious lectures, and especially at religious services,
  cannot be too carefully guarded against.</p>

  <p>Mention has already been made of the liability of moisture to condense
  on the surfaces of the condensers or slides, and to avoid this, so far as
  the condensers are concerned, it is well to light up say ten minutes
  before the lantern is actually wanted, or alternatively to take out the
  condensers and thoroughly warm them in front of a stove, or to place them
  wrapped in a cloth on hot-water pipes. The slides should in the same
  manner be warmed before using and should be finally held above the
  lantern or placed on the top, if this is flat, the last thing before
  being placed in the carrier. If these precautions are omitted, on a cold
  night the first surface of the condenser will become so covered with
  moisture as to almost obscure the slide, and this will quickly disappear
  <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>with the heat of the lantern. Next, the two
  inner surfaces of the condensers will behave in turn in the same way, and
  will take considerably longer to clear, especially if the ventilation of
  the condenser is poor; then the fourth surface will take up the running,
  and finally, when the lanternist is congratulating himself that the
  trouble is over, each successive slide will become affected in the same
  way. With an operator who knows his business, none of these troubles
  should occur.</p>

  <p><b>Accidents.</b>&mdash;These will occur sometimes, even in the best
  managed exhibition; the rubber tubing feeding a limelight jet gets kinked
  or trodden on, or a fuse melts if electric light is being used, &amp;c.,
  and out goes the light. In such cases a loud request such as, 'Would you
  mind turning up the light for a minute, please,' accompanied by a
  good-humoured laugh, usually allays the fears of 'nervy' people. An
  operator must never get 'nervy' himself. I have known of more than one
  fiasco because some little hitch occurred, and two or three timid ladies
  crowded round and asked anxious questions, till the lanternist lost his
  head. In one such case the cautious superintendent at a children's
  entertainment decided that it would be safer not to have the exhibition
  at all, simply because a regulator was not screwed tightly enough into a
  cylinder to prevent an escape of gas, only the operator (a somewhat
  youthful one) had been driven to the verge of lunacy by continual
  questions of the standard type, 'Are you sure it is safe?' 'Will it blow
  up?' 'Are you certain you understand it?' &amp;c., &amp;c. More serious
  accidents, such as the entire lantern getting upset, ought never to
  occur, and it is up to the lanternist to take whatever precautions he
  deems necessary to safeguard his instrument. With a juvenile audience,
  for example, it is often a good thing to arrange a barricade of forms
  round the lantern and to see that no one comes within it.</p>

  <p>Finally, 'whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well,' and
  this is as true of lantern exhibiting as of anything <!-- Page 87
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>else. There are
  a deplorable number of lantern exhibitions given with the sheet hanging
  in creases, dirty lenses, light poorly adjusted and centred, and
  occasionally slides shown upside down. A conscientious lanternist should
  see to <i>every</i> detail; slipshod methods, as in everything else, mean
  poor results.</p>
